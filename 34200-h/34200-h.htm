<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Although</span> it is admitted by all teachers, in theory at
least, that morals and manners are essential subjects
in the curriculum of life, how very few give them an
appointed place in the school routine.     Every other
subject has its special time allotted, but these&mdash;the
most important subjects&mdash;are left to chance, or taken
up, haphazard, at any time; surely this is wrong.</div>

<p>Incidents often occur in the school or home life which
afford fitting opportunity for the inculcation of some
special moral truth, but maybe the teacher or mother
has no suitable illustration just at hand, and the occasion
is passed over with a reproof.     It is hoped that where
such want is felt this little book may supply the need.</p>

<p>The stories may be either told or read to the children,
and are as suitable for the home as the school. "The
Fairy Temple" should be read as an introduction
to the Story Lessons, for the <i>teaching</i> of the latter is
based on this introductory fairy tale.     If used at home
the blackboard sketch may be written on a slate or slip
of paper.     The children will not weary if the stories are
repeated again and again (this at least was the writer's
experience), and they will be eager to pronounce what
is the teaching of the tale.     In this way the lessons are
reiterated and enforced.     The method is one which the
writer found exceedingly effective during long years of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
experience.     Picture-teaching is an ideal way of conveying
truths to children, and these little stories are
intended to be pictures in which the children may see
and contrast the good with the bad, and learn to love
the good.     The faults of young children are almost
invariably due either to thoughtlessness or want of
knowledge, and the little ones are delighted to learn
and put into practice the lessons taught in these stories,
which teaching should be applied in the class or home
as occasion arises. <i>E.g.</i>, a child is passing in front of
another without any apology, the teacher says, immediately:
"Remember Minnie, you do not wish to be
rude, like she was" (<a href="#SL_111">Story Lesson 111</a>). Or if a child
omits to say "Thank you," he may be reminded by
asking: "Have you forgotten 'Alec and the Fairies'?"
(<a href="#SL_95">Story Lesson 95</a>). The story lessons should be read
to the children until they become perfectly familiar
with them, so that each may be applied in the manner
indicated.</p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTORY STORY.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_1" id="SL_1"></a>1. The Fairy Temple.</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(The following story should be read to the children <b>first</b>,
as it forms a kind of groundwork for the Story Lessons
which follow.)</p></div>

<p>It was night&mdash;a glorious, moonlight night, and in the
shade of the leafy woods the Queen of the fairies was
calling her little people together by the sweet tones of a
tinkling, silver bell. When they were all gathered round,
she said: "My dear children, I am going to do a great work,
and I want you all to help me". At this the fairies spread
their wings and bowed, for they were always ready to do
the bidding of their Queen. They were all dressed in lovely
colours, of a gauzy substance, finer than any silk that ever
was seen, and their names were called after the colours
they wore. The Queen's robe was of purple and gold, and
glittered grandly in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I have determined," said the Queen, "to build a Temple
of precious stones, and <b>your</b> work will be to bring me the
material." "Rosy-wings," she continued, turning to a little
fairy clad in delicate pink, and fair as a rose, "you shall
bring rubies." "Grass-green," to a fairy dressed in green,
"your work is to find emeralds; and Shiny-wings, you will
go to the mermaids and ask them to give you pearls."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Now there stood near the Queen six tiny, fairy sisters,
whose robes were whiter and purer than any. The sisters
were all called by the same name&mdash;"Crystal-clear," and they
waited to hear what their work was to be.</p>

<p>"Sisters Crystal-clear," said the Queen, "you shall all of
you bring diamonds; we shall need so many diamonds."</p>

<p>There was another fairy standing there, whose robe
seemed to change into many colours as it shimmered in
the moonlight, just as you have seen the sky change colour
at sunset, and to her the Queen said, "Rainbow-robe, go
and find the opal".</p>

<p>Then there were three other fairy sisters called "Gold-wings,"
who were always trying to help the other fairies,
and to do good to everybody, and the Queen told them to
bring fine gold to fasten the precious stones together.</p>

<p>These are not <b>all</b> the fairies who were there; some others
wore blue, some yellow, and the Queen gave them all their
work. Then she rang a tiny, silver bell, and they all spread
their wings and bowed before they flew away to do her
bidding.</p>

<p>After many days the fairies came together to bring their
precious treasures to the Queen. How they carried them I
scarcely know, but there was a little girl, many years ago,
who often paused at the window of a jeweller's shop to gaze
at a tiny, silver boy, with silver wings, wheeling a silver
wheel-barrow full of rings, and the little girl thought that
perhaps the fairies carried things in the same way. Anyhow,
they all came to the Queen bringing their burdens, and
she soon set to work on the Temple.</p>

<p>"The foundations must be laid with diamonds," said the
Queen. "Where are the six sisters? Ah! here they come
with the lovely, shining diamonds, which are like themselves,
'clear as crystal'. Now little Gold-wings, bring
<b>your</b> treasure," and the three little sisters brought the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
finest of gold. So the work went merrily on, and the fairies
danced in glee as they saw the glittering Temple growing
under the clever hands of the Queen. She made the doors
of pearls and the windows of rubies, and the roof she said
should be of opal, because it would show many colours
when the light played upon it.</p>

<p>At last the lovely building was finished, and after the
fairies had danced joyfully round it in a ring again and
again, until they could dance no longer, they gathered in a
group round the dear Queen, and thanked her for having
made so beautiful a Temple.</p>

<p>"It is quite the loveliest thing in the world, I am sure,"
said Rosy-wings.</p>

<p>"Not quite," replied the Queen, "mortals have it in their
power to make a lovelier Temple than ours."</p>

<p>"Who are 'mortals'?" asked Shiny-wings.</p>

<p>"Boys and girls are mortals," said the Queen, "and
grown-up people also."</p>

<p>"I have never seen mortals build anything half so pretty
as our Temple," said Grass-green; "their houses are made
of stone and brick."</p>

<p>"Ah! Grass-green," answered the Queen, smiling, "you
have never seen the Temple I am speaking of, but it <b>is</b>
better than ours, for it lasts&mdash;lasts for ever. Wind and
rain, frost and snow, will spoil our Temple in time; but the
Temple of the mortals lives on, and is never destroyed."</p>

<p>"Do tell us about it, dear Queen," said all the fairies;
"we will try to understand."</p>

<p>"It is called by rather a long word," said the Queen,
"its name is 'character'; <b>that</b> is what the mortals build,
and the stones they use are more precious than our stones.
I will tell you the names of some of them. First there is
<b>Truth</b>, clear and bright like the diamonds; that must be the
foundation; no good character can be made without Truth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the sisters Crystal-clear smiled at each other and
said, "We brought diamonds for truth".</p>

<p>"There are <b>Honesty</b>, <b>Obedience</b>, and many others," continued
the Queen, "and <b>Kindness</b>, which is like the pure
gold that was brought by Gold-wings, and makes a lovely
setting for all the other stones."</p>

<p>The little fairies were glad to hear all this about the
Temple which the mortals build, and Gold-wings said that
she would like above everything to be able to help boys and
girls to make their Temple beautiful, and the other fairies
said the same; so the Queen said they all might try to help
them, for each boy and girl <b>must</b> build a Temple, and the
name of that Temple is Character.</p>

<h2>II. OBEDIENCE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>2. The Two Voices.</div>

<p>There was once a little boy who said that whenever he
was going to do anything wrong he heard two voices speaking
to him. Do you know what he meant? Perhaps this
story will help you.</p>

<p>The boy's name was Cecil. Cecil's father had a very
beautiful and rare canary, which had been brought far over
the sea as a present to him.</p>

<p>Cecil often helped to feed the canary and give it fresh
water, and sometimes his father would allow him to open
the door of the cage, and the bird would come out and perch
on his hand, which delighted Cecil very much, but he was
not allowed to open the door of the cage unless his father
was with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, however, Cecil came to the cage alone, and
while he watched the canary, a little voice said, "Open the
door and take him out; father will never know". That
was a <b>wrong</b> voice, and Cecil tried not to listen. It would
have been better if he had gone away from the cage, but he
did not; and the voice came again, "Open the door and let
him out". And another little voice said, "No, don't; your
father said you must not". But Cecil listened to the <b>wrong</b>
voice; he opened the door gently, and out flew the pretty
bird. First it perched on his finger, then it flew about the
room, and then&mdash;Cecil had not noticed that the window was
open&mdash;then, before he knew, out of the window flew the
canary, and poor Cecil burst into tears. "Oh! if I had
listened to the <b>good</b> voice, the <b>right</b> voice, and not opened
the door! Father will be so angry." Then the <b>bad</b> voice
came again and said, "Don't tell your father; say you know
nothing about it ". But Cecil did not listen this time; he
was too brave a boy to tell his father a lie, and he determined
to tell the truth and be punished, if necessary.</p>

<p>Of course his father was very sorry to lose his beautiful
canary, and more sorry still that his little son had been
disobedient, but he was glad that Cecil told him the truth.</p>

<p>Now do you know the two things that the <b>wrong</b> voice
told Cecil to do? It told him (1) Not to obey; (2) Not to
tell the truth. I think we have all heard those two voices,
not with our ears, but <b>within</b> us. Let us always listen to
the <b>good</b> voice&mdash;the <b>right</b> voice.</p>

Two voices:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><b>1st. Good, says, "Obey," "Speak the truth".</b></span><br />

<a name="SL_3" id="SL_3"></a>3. The Pilot.</div>

<p>You know that the country in which you live is an island?
That means there is water all round it, and that water is
the sea.</p>

<p>England and Scotland are joined together in one large
island; and if you want to go to any other country, you
must sail in a ship. A great many ships come to England,
bringing us tea, coffee, sugar, oranges and many other things,
and the towns they come to are called <b>ports</b>. London is a
port, so is Liverpool; and in the North of England is another
port called Hull. To get to Hull from the sea we
have to sail up a wide river called the Humber for more
than twenty miles. This river has a great many sandbanks
in it, and there are men called <b>pilots</b> who know just where
these sandbanks lie, and they are the ones who can guide
the ships safely into port.</p>

<p>One day there was a captain who brought his ship into
the river, and said to himself, "I do not want the pilot
on board, I can guide the ship myself". So he did not
hoist the "union jack" on the foremast head, which means
"Pilot come on board"; and the pilot did not come.</p>

<p>For a little time the good ship sailed along all right, but
presently they found that she was not moving at all. What
had happened? The ship was stuck fast on a sandbank, and
the foolish captain wished now that he had taken the pilot
on board. First he had to go out in the little boat and fetch
a "tug-boat" to pull the ship off the sandbank, and then he
was glad enough to have the pilot on board, and to let him
guide the ship just as he liked. Why could not the captain
guide the ship? Because he did not know the way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Have you ever known children who did not like to do as
they were told? who thought that <b>they</b> knew best&mdash;better
than father or mother? They are like the foolish captain,
who tried to guide his ship when he did not know the way.
Fathers and mothers are like the pilot, who knew which
was the best way to take; and wise children are willing to
be guided, for <b>they</b> do not know the way any more than
the captain did.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<b>Why</b> do we obey?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><b>Because we do not Know the Way.</b></span><br />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The story and its teaching may be further impressed on the minds
of the children by a sand lesson:&mdash;</p>

<p>Place a blackboard or large piece of oil-cloth on the floor, and make
an "island" in sand, and in the "island" form a large "estuary,"
with little heaps of sand dotted about in it, to represent sandbanks.
The sailors cannot <b>see</b> the sandbanks, for they are all covered with
water in the <b>real</b> river, so we will take a duster and spread it over these
sandbanks. Now, take a tiny boat and ask one of the children to sail
it up the river, keeping clear of the sandbanks. The children will soon
see that it cannot be done, and the "blackboard" lesson may be again
enforced.</p></div>

<a name="SL_4" id="SL_4"></a>4. The Dog that did not like to be Washed.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>

<p>A lady once had a dog of which she was very fond. The
dog was fond of his mistress also, and loved to romp by her
side when she was out walking, or to lie at her feet as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
sat at work. But the dog had one serious fault&mdash;he did not
like to be washed, and he was so savage when he <b>was</b>
put into the bath, that at last none of the servants dare
do it.</p>

<p>The lady decided that she would not take any more notice
of the dog until he was willing to have his bath quietly, so
she did not take him out with her for walks, nor allow him
to come near her in the house. There were no pattings, no
caresses, no romps, and he began to look quite wretched and
miserable. You see the dog did not like his mistress to be
vexed with him, and he felt very unhappy&mdash;so unhappy that
at last he could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>Then one morning he crept quietly up to the lady and
gave her a look which she knew quite well meant, "I cannot
bear this any longer; I will be good".</p>

<p>So he was put in the bath, and though he had to be
scrubbed very hard&mdash;for by this time he was unusually dirty&mdash;he
stood still quite patiently, and when it was all over, he
bounded to his mistress with a joyous bark and a wag of the
tail, as much as to say, "It is all right now".</p>

<p>After this he was allowed to go for walks as usual, and
was once more a happy dog, and he never objected to his
bath afterwards.</p>

<p>The dog could not bear to grieve his mistress; and how
much more should children be sorry to grieve kind father
and mother, who do so much for them.</p>

5. Robert and the Marbles.</div>

<p>A little boy named Robert was having a game at marbles
with a number of other boys, and it had just come his turn
to play. He meant to win, and was carefully aiming the
marble, when he heard his mother's voice calling, "Robert,
I want you". Quick as thought the marbles were dropped
into his pocket, and off he ran to see what mother wanted.</p>

<a name="SL_6" id="SL_6"></a>6. Jimmy and the Overcoat.</div>

<p>I was in a house one day where a boy was getting ready
to go to school. His bag was slung over his shoulder, and
he was just reaching his cap from the peg, when his mother
said, "Put on your overcoat, Jimmy; it is rather cold this
morning". Oh, what a fuss there was! How he argued
with his mother, "It was not cold; he hated overcoats.
Could he not take it over his arm, or put it on in the afternoon?"
Many more objections he made, and when at last
he <b>had</b> put it on, he went out grumbling, and slammed the
door after him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>Can you guess how his mother felt? "Unhappy," you
will say. And do you think it is right, dear children, to
make mother unhappy? I am sure you do not.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Little child with eyes so blue,<br />
What has mother done for you?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Taught your little feet to stand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Led you gently by the hand,</span><br />

Just obey, and leave the rest.<br />
</div>

<p>You see Jimmy thought that he knew better than his
mother, but he did not. Children need to be guided like the
boat in the Humber (<a href="#SL_3">Story Lesson 3</a>), for they are not very
wise; and when we obey, we are building up our Temple
with beautiful stones.</p>

<h2>III. LOYALTY.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>7. Rowland and the Apple Tart.</div>

<p>Perhaps you have never heard the word Loyalty before,
and maybe Rowland had not either, but he knew what it
meant, and tried to practise it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Rowland was not a very strong little boy, and he could
not eat so many different kinds of food as some children
can, for some of them made him sick. Among other things
he was forbidden to take pastry. His mother, who loved
him very dearly, had one day said to him, "Rowland, my
boy, I cannot always be with you, but I trust you to do
what I wish," and Rowland said he would try always to
remember.</p>

<p>One time he was invited to go and stay with his cousins,
who lived in a fine old house in the country. They were
strong, healthy, rosy children, quite a contrast to their
delicate little cousin, and perhaps they were a little rough
and rude as well.</p>

<p>There was a large apple tart for dinner one day, and when
Rowland said, "I do not wish for any, Auntie, thank you,"
his cousins looked at him in surprise, and the eldest said
scornfully, "I am glad that <b>I</b> am not delicate," and the next
boy remarked, "What a fad!" while the third muttered
"Baby". This was all very hard to bear, and when his
Aunt said, "I am sure a little will not hurt you," Rowland
felt very much inclined to give in, but he remembered that
his mother trusted him, and he remained true to her wishes.</p>

<p>This is Loyalty, doing what is right even when there
is no one there to see.</p>

8. Lucy and the Jug of Milk.</div>

<p>"Lucy," said her mother, "just run to the dairy and
fetch a pint of milk for me, here is the money; and do
remember, child, to look where you are going, so that you
do not stumble and drop the jug." I am afraid Lucy was
a little like another girl you will hear of (<a href="#SL_103">Story Lesson 103</a>);
she was too fond of staring about, and perhaps rather
careless.</p>

<p>However, she went to the dairy and bought the milk, and
had returned half-way home without any mishap, when she
met a flock of sheep coming down the road, followed by
a large sheep-dog. Lucy stood on the pavement to watch
them pass; it was such fun to see the sheep-dog scamper
from one side to the other, and the timid sheep spring
forward as soon as the dog came near them. So far the
milk was safe; but, after the sheep had passed, Lucy thought
she would just turn round to have one more peep at them,
and oh, dear, her foot tripped against a stone, and down she
fell, milk, and jug, and all, and the jug was smashed to
pieces.</p>

<p>Lucy was in great trouble, and as she stood there and
looked at the broken jug, and the milk trickling down the
gutter, she cried bitterly.</p>

<p>A big boy who was passing by at the time, and had seen
the accident, came across the road and said to her: "Don't

9. Mabel and Fritz.</div>

<p>This is a story of a dear little curly-headed girl called
Mabel, whom everybody loved. She was so bright, and
happy, and good-tempered, one could not help loving her,
and when you looked into her clear, blue eyes, you could
see that she was a frank, truthful child, who had nothing
to hide, for she tried to listen to the Good Voice, and do
what was right.</p>

<p>One day Mabel was having a romp with her little dog,
Fritz, in the kitchen. Up and down she chased him, and
away he went, jumping over the chairs, hiding under the
dresser, always followed by Mabel, until at last he leaped
on the table, and in trying to make him come down, Mabel
and the dog together overturned a tray full of clean, starched
linen that was on the table. Mabel had been giving Fritz<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
some water to drink a little before this, and in doing so had
spilt a good deal on the floor, so the clean cuffs and collars
rolled over in the wet, and were quite spoiled.</p>

<p>Mabel's mother happened to come in just when the tray
fell with a bang, and as the dog jumped down from the table
at the same moment she thought he had done it, and Mabel
did not tell that she was in fault, so poor Fritz was chained
up in his kennel, and kept without dinner as a punishment.</p>

<p>Mabel felt sad about it all the rest of the day, and when
she was put to bed at night, and mamma had left her, she
did not go to sleep as usual, but tossed about on the pillow,
until her little curly head was quite hot and tired. Then
she began to cry. Mabel was listening to the Good Voice
now, and it said, "Oh, Mabel, <b>you</b> helped Fritz to overturn
the tray, and <b>he</b> got all the blame, how mean of you!"
Mabel sobbed louder when she thought of herself as being
mean, and her mother hearing the noise came to see what
was the matter. Then Mabel confessed all, and her mother
said, "Perhaps my little girl did not know that we could be
untruthful <b>by not speaking at all</b>, but you see it is quite
possible".</p>

<p>I do not think Mabel ever forgot the lesson which she
learnt that</p>

10. A Game of Cricket.</div>

<p>Two boys were playing at bat and ball in a field. There
was a high hedge on one side of the field, and on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
side of the hedge was a market garden, where things are
grown to be afterwards sold in the market. The boys had
been playing some time, when the "batter," giving the ball
a very hard blow, sent it over the hedge, and <b>both</b> the boys
heard a loud crash as of breaking glass. They picked up
the wickets quickly, and carried them, with the bat, to a
hut that stood in the field, and were hurrying away when
the gardener came and stopped them, asking, "Have you
sent a cricket-ball over the hedge into my cucumber frame?"
The boy who had struck the ball answered, "I did not see
a ball go into your frame," and the other boy said, "Neither
did I".</p>

<p>They did not <b>see</b> the ball break the glass, but they both
<b>knew</b> that it had crashed into the frame, and though the
words they spoke might be true, the lie was there all the
same.</p>

<p>Supposing the sisters "Crystal-clear" had brought to the
Fairy Queen a diamond that was only good on one side, do
you think she would have put it in the Temple? No, indeed,
she would have said it was only <b>half</b> true; and so we must
put away anything that <b>looks</b> like truth, but is not truth.
How wrong it is to make believe we have not done a thing,
when all the time we have.</p>

<p>Dear children, be true all through! Have you ever seen
a glass jar of pure honey, no bits of wax floating in it, all
clear and pure? Let your heart be like that, <b>sincere</b>, which
means "without wax, clear and pure".</p>

<p>One day three little girls were talking about hats and
feathers.</p>

<p>The first girl said: "I have such a long feather in my
best hat; it goes all down one side".</p>

<p>Then the next girl said: "Oh! <b>my</b> feather is longer than
that, for it goes all round the hat"; and the third girl said:
"Ah! but <b>my</b> feather is longer than either of yours, for it
goes round the hat and hangs down behind as well".</p>

<p>On the next Sunday each of these little girls went walking
in the park with her parents, wearing her best hat with
the wonderful feather; it never occurred to <b>one</b> of them
that she might meet the other two, but that is just what
happened, and the three "long" feathers proved to be
nothing but three <b>short</b>, little feathers, one in each hat!
Can you guess how <b>ashamed</b> each girl felt?</p>

<p>You have seen a piece of elastic stretched out. How <b>long</b>
you can make it, and how <b>short</b> it goes when you leave off
stretching! Each girl wanted to be better than the other,
and to <b>appear</b> so, each "stretched" the story of her
feather, just as the length of elastic was stretched, forgetting
that</p>

<h2>V. HONESTY.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>12. Lulu and the Pretty Coloured Wool.</div>

<p>The little children who went to school long years ago
did not have pretty things to play with as you have&mdash;no
kindergarten balls with bright colours, nor nice bricks
with which to build houses and churches! There was a
little girl named Lulu who went to a dame's school in
those far-off days, and most of the time she had to sit
knitting a long, grey stocking, though she was only six
years old.</p>

<p>Some of the older girls were sewing on canvas with
pretty coloured wools, and making (what appeared to
little Lulu) most beautiful pictures. How she longed for
a length of the pink or blue wool to have for her very
own!</p>

<p>The school was in a room upstairs, and at the head of
the stair there was a window, with a deep window-sill in
front of it. As Lulu came out of the schoolroom one day
to take a message for the teacher, and turned to close
the door after her, she saw (oh, lovely sight!) that the
window-sill was piled up with bundles of the pretty
coloured wool that she liked so much. Oh! how she
wished for a little of it! And, see, there is some rose-pink
wool on the top, cut into lengths ready for the girls
to sew with! It is too much for poor little Lulu; she
draws out one! two! three lengths of the wool, folds it
up hastily, puts it in her pocket, and runs down the stair
on the errand she has been sent.</p>

<p>But is she happy? Oh, no! for a little Voice says:
"Lulu, you are stealing; the wool is not yours!" For
a few minutes the wool rests in her pocket, and then she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
runs back up the stair; the schoolroom door is still closed
as Lulu draws the wool from her pocket, and gently puts
it back on the window-sill. Then she takes the message
and returns to her place in the schoolroom, and to the
knitting of her long stocking, hot and ashamed at the
thought of what she has done, but glad in her heart that
she listened to the Good Voice, and did not keep the
wool.</p>

<p>Had any one seen her? Did any one know about it?
Yes, there were loving Eyes watching little Lulu, and the
One who looked down was very glad when she listened
to the Good Voice. Do you know who it was?</p>

13. Carl and the Lump of Sugar.</div>

<p>There are some people who think that taking <b>little</b> things
is not stealing. But it <b>is</b>.</p>

<p>There was a little boy, named Carl, who began his
wrong-doing by taking a piece of sugar. Then he took
another piece, and another; but he always did it when his
mother was not looking. We always want to hide the
doing of wrong&mdash;we feel so ashamed.</p>

<p>One day Carl's mother sent him to the shop for something,
and he kept a halfpenny out of the change. His
mother did not notice it; she never thought her little boy
would steal.</p>

<p>So it went on from bad to worse, until one day he stole
a shilling from a boy in the school, and was expelled.</p>

<p>As Carl grew older he took larger sums, and you will
not be surprised to hear that in the end he was sent to
prison, and nearly broke his mother's heart.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>14. Lilie and the Scent.</div>

<p>Lilie's cousin had a bottle of scent given to her, and it
had such a pleasant smell that one day, when Lilie was
alone in the room, she thought she would like a little, so
she unscrewed the stopper, and sprinkled a few drops on
her handkerchief. I do not suppose her cousin would
have been angry if she had known, but Lilie knew the
scent was not hers, and she was miserable the moment
she had taken it, and had no peace until she confessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the fault, and asked her cousin's forgiveness. I wish Carl
had felt like that about the piece of sugar; do not you?
Then he would never have taken the larger things, and
been sent to prison.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>15. Copying.</div>

<p>It was the Christmas examination at school, and the
boys were all at their desks ready for the questions in
arithmetic. Will Jones's desk was next Tom Hardy's, and
everybody thought that <b>one</b> of these two boys would win
the prize.</p>

<p>As soon as the questions had been given out, the boys
set to work. Tom did all his sums on a scrap of paper
first, then he copied them out carefully, and, after handing
his paper to the master, left the room. Unfortunately he
left the scrap of paper on which he had worked his sums
lying on the desk. Will snatched it up, and looked to see
if his answers were the same. No! two were different.
Tom's would be sure to be right; so he copied the sums
from Tom's scrap of paper. It was stealing, of course;
just as much stealing as if he had taken Tom's pen or
knife. Besides, it is so mean to let some one else do the
work and then steal it from them&mdash;even the <b>birds</b> know
that.</p>

<p>Some little birds were building themselves a nest, and
to save the trouble of gathering materials, they went and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
took some twigs and other things from <b>another bird's
nest</b> that was being built. But when the old birds saw
what the little ones had done, they set to work and pulled
the nest all to pieces. That was to teach them to go
and find their <b>own</b> twigs and sticks, and not to steal from
others.</p>

<p>Of course Will was not happy. There was a little Voice
within that would not let him rest, and when the boys kept
talking about the arithmetic prize, and wondering who would
get it, he felt as though he would like to go and hide somewhere,
he was so ashamed. That is one of the results of
wrong-doing, as we said before&mdash;it always makes us
ashamed.</p>

<p>At last the day came when the master would tell who
were the prize-winners. The boys were all sitting at
their desks listening as the master read out these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tom Hardy and Will Jones have all their sums right,
but as Will's paper is the neater of the two, <b>he</b> will take
the first prize".</p>

<p>The boys clapped their hands, but Will was not glad.
The Voice within spoke louder and louder, so loudly that
Will was almost afraid some of the other boys would hear
it, and his face grew red and hot. At last he determined to
obey the Good Voice and tell the truth, so he rose from his
seat, walked up to the master, and said: "Please, sir, the
prize does not belong to me, for I stole two of my answers
from Tom Hardy. I am very sorry."</p>

<p>The master was greatly surprised, but he could see that
Will was very sorry and unhappy. He held out his hand
to him, and said: "I am glad, Will, that you have been
brave enough to confess this. It will make you far happier
than the prize would have done, seeing that you had not
honestly won it." So the prize went to Tom, and Will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was never guilty of copying again; he remembered too well
the unhappiness that followed it.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>16. On Finding Things.</div>

<p>When Lulu reached her fifteenth birthday she had a
watch given to her. One afternoon she was walking through
a wood, up a steep and rocky path, and when she reached
the top she stood for a few moments to rest. Looking back
down the wood she saw a boy coming by the same path, and
when about half-way up he stooped down as if to raise something
from the ground, but the thought did not occur to
Lulu that it might be anything belonging to her.</p>

<p>When she was rested she walked on until she came to a
house just outside the wood, where she was to take tea with
a friend.</p>

<p>After tea they sat and worked until the sun began to go
down. Then Lulu said, "I think I must be going home;
I will see what time it is," and she was going to take out
her watch, when, alas! she found it was gone. "Oh, dear!"
said she, "what shall I do? How careless of me to put it
in my belt; it was a present from my brother!" Then she
suddenly remembered standing at the top of the path and
seeing the boy pick something up. "That would be my
watch," said she. And so it was.</p>

<p>The boy had followed her up the wood, and had seen
her go into the house, but he did not give up the watch.
He waited until some bills were posted offering a reward of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
&pound;1, then he brought the watch and took the sovereign. If
he had been an honest boy he would not have waited, but
would have given up the watch at once. We ought not to
wish any reward for doing what is right. It is quite enough
to have the happiness that comes from obeying the Good
Voice. We cannot build up a good character without
honesty.</p>

<h2>VI. KINDNESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>17. Squeaking Wheels.</div>

<p>A lady was one day taking a walk along a country lane,
and just as she was passing the gate of a field a horse and
cart came out, and went down the road in the same direction
as she was going, and oh! how the wheels did squeak!
The lady longed to get away from the sound of them. First
she walked very quickly, hoping to get well ahead; but no,
the horse hurried up too, and kept pace with her. Perhaps
<b>he</b> disliked the squeaking, and wanted his journey to be
quickly finished. Then she lingered behind, and sauntered
along slowly, but squeak, squeak&mdash;the hateful sound was still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
there. At last the cart was driven down a lane to the right,
and now the lady could listen to the songs of the birds, the
humming of the bees, and the sweet rustle of the leaves as
the wind played amongst them. "How much pleasanter,"
thought she, "are these sounds than the squeaking of the
wheels."</p>

<p>I wonder if you have ever seen any little children who
make you think of those disagreeable wheels? They are
children who do not like to lend their toys, or to play the
games that their companions suggest, but who like, instead,
to please themselves.</p>

<p>Do you know what the wheels needed to make them go
sweetly? They needed oil. And the disagreeable children
who grate on us with their selfish, unkind ways, need <b>another</b>
sort of oil&mdash;the oil of kindness. <b>That</b> will make things go
sweetly; so we will write on the blackboard</p>

<p>Did you know that trees and birds, bees and flowers
could be kind to each other? They <b>can</b>; I will tell you
how.</p>

<p>See the pretty red cherries growing on that tree. All
little children like cherries, and the birds like them too.</p>

<p>A little bird comes flying to the cherry tree and asks,
"May I have one of these rosy little balls, please?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little bird," says the cherry tree; "take some, by
all means."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>So the bird has a nice fruit banquet with the cherries, and
then, what do you think <b>he</b> does for the tree?</p>

<p>"Oh!" you say, "a little bird cannot do <b>anything</b> that
would help a big tree." But he can.</p>

<p>When he has eaten the cherry he drops the stone, and
sometimes it sinks into the ground, and from it a young
cherry tree springs up. The tree could not do that for itself,
so we see that</p>

Look into the large cup of the lily, and there, deep down,
you will see some sweet, delicious juice. What is it for?
Ask the bee; she will tell you.</p>

<p>Here she comes, and down goes her long tongue into the
flower. "Ah! Mrs. Bee, the honey is for you, I see. And
pray, what have you done for the flower? Nothing, I'm
afraid."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have," hums the bee. "I brought her some
flower-dust (pollen) on my back from another tiger-lily that
I have been visiting to make her seeds grow. When I dip
down into the flower some of the 'dust' clings to me, so I take
it to the next tiger-lily that I visit, and she is very much
obliged to me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>20. Lulu and the Bundle.</div>

<p>Do you remember the story of "Lulu and the Wool"?
This is a true tale of the same little girl when she was
grown older.</p>

<p>Lulu's home was at the top of a hill, and the road leading
up to it was very steep. One summer evening, as Lulu
walked home from town, she overtook a woman coming
from market, and carrying a heavy basket as well as a
bundle which was tied up in a blue checked handkerchief.</p>

<p>The poor woman stopped to rest just as Lulu came up to
her. "Let me carry your bundle," said Lulu. And before
the woman could answer she had picked it up and was
trudging along.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your mother would not be pleased to see you
carrying my bundle?" sighed the woman. "Some people
think it is vulgar to be seen carrying parcels."</p>

<p>"It is never vulgar to be kind," answered Lulu. "That
is what mother would say." So they walked on until they
came to the cottage, and Lulu left the grateful woman at her
own door, and forgot all about it.</p>

<p>Some years after, Lulu had been away from home, and,
missing her train, she returned laden with parcels one dark,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wet night. There was no one to meet her, no one to help
to carry her parcels, and the rain was pouring down. She
hurried outside to look for a cab, but there was not one to
be had, so she began to walk up the hill. After going a very
little way she stopped to rest, the parcels were so heavy;
and just then a man came up and said: "Give me your
parcels, miss, they seem too heavy for you". And Lulu,
astonished, handed them to him. He carried them to the
door of her mother's house, and hardly waited to hear the
grateful thanks Lulu would have poured out.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard these words: "Give, and it shall
be given unto you". I think they came true in this little
story. Do not you?</p>

<p>Let us all try to build a good deal of the "pure gold" of
Kindness into our "Temple".</p>

<h2>VII. THOUGHTFULNESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_21" id="SL_21"></a>21. Baby Elsie and the Stool.</div>

<p>If you place your hand on your head you will feel
something hard just beneath the hair. What is it? It
is bone. Pass your hand all over your head and you will
still feel the bone. It is called the skull, and it covers up
a wonderful thing called the brain, with which we think,
and learn, and remember.</p>

<p>A little baby girl was toddling about the room one
afternoon while her mother sat sewing. The baby was a
year and a half old. She had only just learned to walk,
and could not talk much, but she had begun to think.
Presently she noticed a little stool under the table, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
after a great deal of trouble she managed to get it out.
Can you guess what she wanted it for? (Let children
try to answer.) She wanted it for mother's feet to rest
upon. Elsie could not <b>say</b> this, but she dragged the stool
until it was close to her mother, and then she patted it,
and said "Mamma," which meant, "Put your feet on it".</p>

<p>Was not that a sweet, kind thing for a one-year-old baby
to do? You see she was learning to think&mdash;to think for
others, and you will not be surprised to hear that she
grew up to be a kind, helpful girl, and was so bright and
happy that her mother called her "Sunshine".</p>

<p>If any one asked me what kind of child I liked best, I
believe the answer would be this: "A child who is
thoughtful of others"; for a child who thinks of others
will not be rude, or rough, or unkind. Who was it
slammed the door when mother had a headache? It was
a child who did not think. Who left his bat lying across
the garden path so that baby tumbled over it and got a
great bump on his little forehead? It was thoughtless
Jimmy. Do not be thoughtless, dear children, for you
cannot help hurting people, if you are thoughtless; and
we are in the world to make it happy, <b>not</b> to <b>hurt</b>.
Thoughtfulness is a lovely jewel; let us all try to build
it into our "Temple".</p>

the ship in a litter a soldier's blanket was rolled up and
placed beneath his head for a pillow to ease his pain.
"Whose blanket is this?" asked he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the soldiers answered that it only belonged to
one of the men. "But I want to know the name of the
man," said Sir Ralph. He was then told that the man's
name was Duncan Roy, and he said: "Then see that
Duncan Roy gets his blanket this very night".</p>

<p>You see how thoughtful he was for the other man's
comfort, so thoughtful that he did not wish to keep
Duncan's blanket even though he himself was dying. Is
it not true that "thoughtfulness" is one of the most
beautiful of the precious stones that you build with.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>23. The Cat and the Parrot.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></div>

<p>A cat and a parrot lived in the same house, and were very
kind and friendly towards each other. One evening there was
no one in the kitchen except the bird and the cat. The cook
had gone upstairs, leaving a bowl full of dough to rise by
the fire. Before long the cat rushed upstairs, mewing and
making signs for the cook to come down, then she jumped
up and seized her apron, and tried to pull her along. What
could be the matter, what had happened? Cook went
downstairs to see, and there was poor Polly shrieking,
calling out, flapping her wings, and struggling with all her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
might "up to her knees" in dough, and stuck quite fast.
Of course the cook lifted the parrot out, and cleaned the
dough from her legs, but if pussy had not been her kind
friend, and run for help, she would have sunk farther and
farther into the dough, and perhaps in the end would have
been smothered.</p>

<p>A ship that was crossing the sea had two monkeys on
board; one of them was larger and older than the other,
though she was not the mother of the younger one. Now
it happened one day that the little monkey fell overboard,
and the bigger one was immediately very much excited.
She had a cord tied round her waist, with which she had
been fastened up, and what do you think she did? She
scrambled down the outside of the ship, until she came to a
ledge, then she held on to the ship with one hand, and with
the other she held out the cord to the poor little monkey
that was struggling in the water. Was not she a clever,
thoughtful, kind monkey? The cord was just a little too
short, so one of the sailors threw out a longer rope, which
the little monkey grasped, and by this means she was brought
safely on board.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>You will remember the story of the monkey, who tried to

<div class='sectiontitle'>25. The Wounded Bird.</div>

<p>There is a beautiful story about birds helping each other
in a book<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which you must read for yourselves when you
grow older.</p>

<p>One day a man was out with his gun, and shot a sea-bird,
called a tern, which fell wounded into the sea, near
the water's edge. The man stood and waited until the
wind should blow the bird near enough for him to reach
it, when, to his surprise, he saw two other terns fly down to
the poor wounded bird and take hold of him, one at each
wing, lift him out of the water, and carry him seawards.
Two other terns followed, and when the first two had carried
him a few yards and were tired, they laid him down gently
and the next two picked him up, and so they went on carrying
him in turns until they reached a rock a good way off,
where they laid him down. The sportsman then made his
way to the rock, but when they saw him coming, a whole
swarm of terns came together, and just before he reached
the place, two of them again lifted up the wounded bird and
bore him out to sea. The man was near enough to have
hindered this if he had wished, but he was so pleased to see
the kindness of the birds that he would not take the poor
creature from them.</p>

<h2>IX. ON BEING BRAVE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>(<span class="smcap">Brave in Danger.</span>)
<br />
26. How Leonard Saved his Little Brother.</div>

<p>Have you ever known a little girl who cried whenever her
face was washed? or a little boy who screamed each time
he had a tumble, although he might not be hurt in the
least? You would not call <b>those</b> brave children, would
you? We say that people are brave when they are not
afraid to face danger, like the men who go out in the life-boat
when the sea is rough to try and save a crew from
shipwreck; or the brave firemen who rescue the inmates
of a burning house. Perhaps you think it is only grown-up
people who can be brave, but that is not so; little children
can be brave also, as you will see from this story of a little
boy, about whom we read in the papers not long ago, and
who lived not far from London. Some children were
playing near a pool, when, by some means, one of them,
a little boy named Arthur, three years old, fell in. All
the children, except one, ran away. (<b>They</b> were not brave,
were they?) The one who remained was little Arthur's
brother, Leonard. He was only five years old, but he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had a brave heart, and he went into the water at once,
although he could not see Arthur, who had fallen on his
back under the water, and was too frightened to get up.
Leonard had seen where he fell, and though he did not
know how deep the water was, he walked in, lifted his
little brother up, and pulled him out. It was all done
much more quickly than I have told you. If Leonard had
run away to fetch some one, instead of doing what he could
himself, his brother must have been drowned, because he
was fast in the mud. I am sure you will say that <b>Leonard</b>
was a brave little boy, and we should not think that <b>he</b>
cries when he is washed, or when he has a little tumble.

<p>What a fuss some children make when they are hurt
ever so little, and if a finger should bleed how dreadfully
frightened they are!</p>

<p>A lady told me this story of two little twin boys whom
she knew. Their names were Bennie and Joey, and they
were just two years old.</p>

<p>One day as they were playing together Bennie cut his
finger, and the blood came out in little drops. Now, the
twins had never seen blood before, and you will think,
maybe, that Bennie began to cry; but he did not. He
looked at his finger and said: "Oh! Joey, look! what is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
this?" "Don't know," said Joey, shaking his head. Then
they both watched the bleeding finger for a little, and at last
Bennie said: "I know, Joey; it is <b>gravy</b>". He had seen
the gravy in the meat, and he thought this was something
like it. Anyhow, it was better than crying and making a
fuss, do you not think?</p>

<p>It was recreation time, and the boys were pretending
to play football, when a boy of six, named Robin, had an
awkward fall and broke his arm. The teacher bound it
up as well as she could, and Robin did not cry, though
the poor arm must have pained him. He walked quietly
through the streets with the teacher, who took him to the
doctor to have the broken bone set, and when the doctor
pulled his arm straight out to get the bones in place before
he bound it up, Robin gave one little cry; that was all. He
is now a grown-up man, but the teacher still remembers
how brave he was when his arm was broken, and feels
proud of her pupil.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of a monkey having toothache? There
was a monkey once who lived in a cage in some gardens in
London, and he had a very bad toothache, which made a large
swelling on his face. The poor creature was in such great pain
that a dentist was sent for. (A dentist, tell the children, is
a man who attends to teeth.) When the monkey was
taken out of the cage he struggled, but as soon as the dentist
placed his hand on the spot he was quite still. He laid
his head down so that the dentist might look at his bad
tooth, and then he allowed him to take it out without
making any fuss whatever. There was a little girl once
who screamed and struggled dreadfully when she was taken
to have her hair cut, and that, you know, does not hurt
at all. Let us learn from the monkey, as we did from
Robin, to</p>

<p>A sparrow was one day flying over a road when he saw
lying there a long strip of rag.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said he, "that would be nice for the nest we are
building; I will take it home." So he picked up one end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in his beak and flew away with it, but the wind blew the
long streamer about his wings, and down he came, tumbling
in the dust. Soon he was up again, and, after giving
himself a little shake, he took the rag by the other end
and mounted in the air. But again it entangled his
wings, and he was soon on the ground. Next he seized
it in the middle, but now there were <b>two</b> loose ends, and
he was entangled more quickly than before.</p>

<p>Then he stopped to think for a minute, and looked at
the rag as much as to say: "What shall I do with you
next"? An idea struck him. He hopped up to the rag,
and with his beak and claws rolled it into a nice little
ball. Then he drove his beak into it, shook his head once
or twice to make sure that the ends were fast, and flew
away in triumph.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>31. The Railway Train.</div>

<p>If you had been a little child a hundred years ago, instead
of now, and had wished to travel to the seaside or any other
place, do you know how you would have got there? You
would have had to travel in a coach, for there were no
trains in those days. I am afraid the little children who
lived then did not get to the seashore as often as you do,
unless they lived near it, for it cost so much money to
ride in the coaches. How is it that we have trains now?</p>

<p>There was a man called George Stephenson&mdash;a poor man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
he was; he did not even know how to read until he went
to a night school when he was eighteen years old, but he
worked and worked at the steam-engine until he had made
one that could draw a train along. So you see that because
this man and others tried and tried again, all those years
ago, we have the nice, quick trains to take us to the seaside
cheaply, and to other places as well. Like the sparrow,

<div class='sectiontitle'>32. The Man who Found America.</div>

<p>A long, long time ago the people in this country did not
even know there <b>was</b> such a place as America; it was
another "try, try again" man that found it out. His
name was Christopher Columbus, and he thought there
must be a country on the other side of that great ocean,
if he could only get across. But it would take a good ship,
and sailors, and money, and he had none of these. He
was in a country called Spain, and he asked the king and
queen to help him, but for a great while they did not.
However, he waited and never gave it up, and at last the
queen said he should go, and off he started with two or
three ships and a number of sailors.</p>

<p>It was more than two months before the new land
appeared, and sometimes the sailors were afraid when it
was very stormy, and wanted to turn back, but Columbus
encouraged them to go on, and at last they saw the land.
They all went on shore, and the first thing they did was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to kneel down and thank God for bringing them safe to
land; then they kissed the ground for very gladness, and
wept tears of joy.</p>

<p>When Columbus came home again, bringing gold, and
cotton, and wonderful birds from the new country, he
was received with great rejoicing by the king and queen
and all the people. Do not forget this lesson:&mdash;</p>

<p>Walter was busy doing his home lessons; he wanted to
get them finished quickly, so that he could join his playmates
at a game of cricket before it was time to go to bed.
He was nearly at the end, and the page was just as neat
as it could be&mdash;for Walter worked very carefully&mdash;when, in
turning the paper over, he gave the pen which was in his
hand a sharp jerk, and a great splash of ink fell in the very
middle of the neat, clean page.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" cried Walter, "all my work is wasted. I
shall get no marks for this lesson unless I write it all over
again; and I wanted so much to go out and have a game."
However, he was a brave boy, and his mother was glad to
notice that he set to work quietly, and soon had it written
over again. When bedtime came, she said: "Walter, your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
accident with the ink made me think of a story. Shall I
tell it to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mother! please do," said Walter, for he loved
stories.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>34. The Drawings Eaten by the Rats.</div>

<p>"There was once a gentleman (Audubon) in America,"
said his mother, "who was very fond of studying birds. He
would go out in the woods to watch them, and he also made
sketches of them, and worked so hard that he had nearly a
thousand of these drawings, which, of course, he valued very
much. One time he was going away from home for some
months, and before he went he collected all his precious
drawings together, put them carefully in a wooden box, and
gave them to a relative to take care of until he came back.</p>

<p>"The time went by and he returned, and soon after asked
for the box containing his treasures. The box was there,
but what do you think? Two rats had found their way into
it, and had made a home there for their young ones, and the
beautiful drawings were all gnawed until nothing was left
but tiny scraps of paper. You can guess how dreadfully disappointed
the poor man would feel. But he tells us that in
a few days he went out to the woods and began his drawings
again as gaily as if nothing had happened; and he was
pleased to think that he might now make better drawings
than before. It was nearly three years before he had made
up for what the rats had eaten. This man must have possessed
the precious jewel of patience. Do you not think
so?"</p>

<p>"What is patience, mother?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"The little Scotch girl said it meant 'wait a wee, and no
weary,'" said his mother; "and I think that is a very good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
meaning. It is like saying that we must wait, and do the
work over again, if necessary, without getting vexed or

<div class='sectiontitle'>35. Playing at Shop.</div>

<p>You have often played at keeping shop, have you not?
Winnie and May were very fond of this game, and when it
was holiday time they played it nearly every day. One
morning they made the "shop" ready as usual; a stool
was to be the "counter," and upon this they placed the
scales, with all the things they meant to sell. When all
was ready, Winnie stood behind the "counter," and said,
"I will be the 'shopman'!"</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed May, "<b>I</b> want to be 'shopman'; let me
come behind the 'counter'." But Winnie would not move,
then May tried to <b>pull</b> her away, and Winnie pushed May,
and in the end both little girls were crying, and the game
was spoilt. Were not they foolish?</p>

<p>How easy it would have been to take it in turns to be
"shopman," and that would have been quite fair to both
little girls. I am afraid we sometimes <b>forget</b> to be <b>fair</b> in
our games. We will tell Winnie and May the story of the
two goats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>36. The Two Goats.</div>

<p>Perhaps you know that goats like to live on the rocks,
and as they have cloven feet (that is, feet that are split up
the middle) they can walk in places that would not be at
all safe for your little feet.</p>

<p>One day two goats met each other on a narrow ledge of
rock where there was not room to pass. Below them was
a steep precipice; if they fell down there they would soon
be dashed to pieces. How should they manage?</p>

<p>It was now that one of the goats did a polite, kind,
graceful act.</p>

<p>She knelt down on the ledge so that the other goat might
walk over her, and when this was done, she rose up and
went on her way, so both the goats were safe and unhurt.</p>

<p>You will think "generous" is a long word, but the stories

<p>Lilie was staying with her auntie, for her mother had gone <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'on'">on</ins>
a voyage with father in his ship.</p>

<p>One day Lilie heard a timid little knock at the back door.
She ran to open it, and saw standing outside a poor little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
girl about her own size, with no shoes or stockings on. She
asked for a piece of bread, and Lilie's auntie went into the
pantry to cut it. While she was away Lilie noticed the little
girl's bare feet, and, without thinking, she took off her own
shoes and gave them to her.</p>

<p>When the girl had gone, auntie asked, "Where are your
shoes, Lilie?" And she replied, "I gave them to the little
girl, auntie. I do not think mother would mind." It would
have been better if Lilie had asked auntie before she gave
away her shoes; but auntie did not scold her; she only said
to herself, "What a generous little soul the child has".</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>38. Bertie and the Porridge.</div>

<p>Bertie was a rosy-faced, healthy boy. His mother lived
in a little cottage in the country, and she was too poor to
buy dainties for her child, but the good, plain food he ate
was quite enough to make him hearty and strong.</p>

<p>His usual breakfast was a basin of porridge mixed with
milk, and one bright, sunny morning he was sitting on the
doorstep, waiting until it should be cool enough for him to
eat, when he saw a very poor, old man leaning on the garden
gate. Bertie felt sure the old man must be wanting
something to eat, he looked so pale and thin, and being a
generous-hearted boy, he carried down his basin of porridge
to the old man, and asked him to eat it, which he did with
great enjoyment, for he was very hungry. I think you will
understand now what being Generous means. We may do
good by giving away things that are of no use to us, but
that is not being generous.</p>

thinking hard things of each other, I fear. Next day, however,
one of the dogs brought a biscuit to the other, and laid
it down beside him, as much as to say, "Let us be friends".
I think the other dog would be sure to forgive him after that,
and we are sure they would both be much happier for being

<div class='sectiontitle'>40. The Blotted Copy-book.</div>

<p>Gladys and Dora were in the same class at school, and
when the teacher promised to give a prize for the cleanest,
neatest and best-written copy-book, they determined to try
and win the prize. Both the little girls wrote their copies
very carefully for several days, but by-and-by Gladys grew a
little careless, and her copies were not so well written as
Dora's. Gladys knew this quite well, and yet she longed for
the prize. What should she do? There was only one copy
more to be written, and then it would have to be decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
who should get the prize. Sad to say, Gladys thought of
a very mean way by which she might spoil Dora's chance
of it.</p>

<p>She went to school one morning very early&mdash;no one was
there; softly she walked to Dora's desk, and drew out her
neat, tidy copy-book, which she opened at the last page,
and, taking a pen, she dipped it in ink, and splashed the
page all over; then she put it back in the desk, and said
to herself, "There, now, the prize will be mine".</p>

<p>But why does Gladys feel so wretched all at once? A
little Voice that you have often heard spoke in her heart,
and said, "Oh! Gladys, how mean, how unkind!" and she
could not <b>help</b> being miserable.</p>

<p>Presently the school assembled, and when the writing
lesson came round the teacher said, "Now, girls, take out
your copy-books and finish them". Dora drew hers out,
and when she opened it and saw the blots her cheeks grew
scarlet and her eyes filled with tears. Just then she turned
and saw Gladys glancing at her in an ashamed sort of way
(as the elephant looked at his driver when he had stolen
the cakes&mdash;<a href="#SL_85">Story Lesson 85</a>), and Dora knew in her heart
that it was Gladys who had spoilt her copy-book. But
she did not tell any one, not even when the teacher said,
"Oh! Dora, what a mess you have made on your nice
copy-book!" but she was thinking all the time, and when
she went home she said to her mother, "Mamma, may I
give my little tin box with the flowers painted on it to
Gladys?" "Why, Dora," said her mother, "I thought
you were very fond of that pretty box!" "So I am,"
replied Dora, "that is why I want Gladys to have it;
please let me give it to her, mother!" So Dora's mother
consented, and next morning Gladys found a small parcel
on her desk, with a scrap of paper at the top, on which
was written, "Gladys, with love from Dora". Dora was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
generous, you see; she returned good for evil, and Gladys
felt far more sorrow for her fault than she would have done
had Dora caused her to be punished. Neither Gladys nor
Dora won the prize, but Gladys learnt a lesson that was
worth more than many prizes, and Dora had a gladness in
her heart that was better than a prize&mdash;the gladness that
comes from listening to the Good Voice. "Good for Evil"
is a beautiful "stone" to have in your Temple.</p>

<h2>XVI. GENTLENESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>41. The Horse and the Child.</div>

<p>Gentleness is a beautiful word, and I daresay you know
what it means. When you are helping baby to walk,
mother will say, "Be <b>gentle</b> with her," which means, "Do
not be rough, do not hurt her". A <b>gentleman</b> is a man
who is gentle, who will not <b>hurt</b>.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of a horse who could behave like a
gentleman? Here is the story.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"A horse was drawing a cart along a narrow lane in
Scotland when it spied a little child playing in the middle
of the road. What do you think the kind, gentle horse
did? It took hold of the little child's clothes with its
teeth, lifted it up, and laid it gently on the bank at the
side of the road, and then it turned its head to see that
the cart had not hurt the child in passing. Did not the
horse behave like a gentleman?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>I have seen boys and girls helping the little ones to
dress in the cloakroom at school, or leading them carefully
down the steps, or carrying the babies over rough places;
<b>this</b> is gentleness, and the gentle boy will grow up to be
a gentle man.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>42. The Overturned Fruit Stall.</div>

<p>You have seen boys playing the game of "Paper Chase,"
or, as it is sometimes called, "Hare and Hounds". One or
two boys start first, each carrying a bag full of small pieces
of paper, which they scatter as they run. Then all the
other boys start, and follow the track made by the scattered
paper.</p>

<p>A number of boys were starting for a "Paper Chase" one
Saturday afternoon, and, passing quickly round a corner of
the street, some of them ran against a little fruit stall and
overturned it. The apples, pears and plums were all rolling
on the ground, and the old woman who belonged to the stall
looked at them in dismay. The boys all ran on except
one, and he stayed behind to help to put the stall right,
and to gather up all the fruit. That boy was <b>gentle</b>
and kind, and the poor old woman could not thank him
enough.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Be <b>gentle</b> to the little ones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be <b>gentle</b> to the old,</span><br />
Be <b>gentle</b> to the lame, to <b>all</b>&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For it is true, I'm told,</span><br />
That <b>gentleness</b> is better far<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than riches, wealth or gold.</span><br />

<h2>XVII. ON BEING GRATEFUL.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>43. Rose and her Birthday Present.</div>

<p>A little girl called Rose had a kind auntie who sent her
half a sovereign for a birthday present. Rose was delighted
with the money, and was always talking of the many nice
things it would buy, but she never thought of writing and
<b>thanking</b> her auntie. That was not grateful, was it? When
we <b>receive</b> anything, we should always think <b>at once</b> of
the giver, and express our thanks without delay. That is
why we say "grace" before eating: we wish to thank our
kind Father above for giving us the nice food to eat.</p>

<p>The days went by, and still auntie received no word of
thanks from her little niece. Then a letter came asking,
"Has Rosy had my letter with the present?" Rose answered
this, and said she <b>had</b> received the letter, and sent
many thanks for the present. But how ashamed she must
have felt that she had not written before! It is not nice to
have to <b>ask</b> people for their thanks or gratitude; it ought to
be given freely without asking.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_44" id="SL_44"></a>44. The Boy who was Grateful.</div>

<p>Little Vernon's father had a tricycle, and one day he fixed
up a seat in front for his little boy, and took him for a nice,
long ride.</p>

<p>Vernon sat facing his father, and he was so delighted with
the ride, and so grateful to his kind father for bringing him,
that he could not help putting his arms round his father's
neck sometimes, and giving him a kiss as they went along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Vernon's father told me this himself, and I was glad to know
that the little boy possessed this precious gift of gratitude, for
it is a lovely "stone" to have in the Temple we are building.</p>

<h2>XVIII. SELF-HELP.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>45. The Crow and the Pitcher.</div>

<p>Perhaps you have heard the fable of the crow who was
thirsty. He found a pitcher with a little water in it, but he
could not get at the water, for the neck of the jug was
narrow.</p>

<p>Did he leave the water and say, "It is of no use to try"?
No; he set to work, and found a way out of the difficulty.
The crow dropped pebbles into the jug, one by one, and
these made the water rise until he could reach it.</p>

<p>(Illustrate by a tumbler with a few tablespoonfuls of water
in it. Drop in some pebbles, and show how the water rises
as the pebbles take its place.) If you have a steep hill to
climb, or a hard lesson to learn, do not sit down and cry,
and think you cannot do it, but be determined that, like the
crow, you will master the difficulty. When you were a
little, tiny child, your father carried you over the rough
places, but as you grow older, you walk over them yourself.
You do not want to be carried now, for you are not helpless
any longer. But I am afraid there are some children who
<b>like</b> to be helpless, and to let mother do everything for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
them. I once knew a girl of ten who could not tie her own
bootlaces; <b>she</b> was helpless. And I knew a little fellow of
six who, when his mother was sick, could put on the kettle,
and make her a cup of tea; he was a <b>helpful</b> boy.</p>

<p>It is brave and nice of boys and girls to help themselves
all they can, and not to be beaten by a little difficulty.
Remember the Sparrow and the Rag (<a href="#SL_30">Story Lesson 30</a>), as
well as the Crow, and</p>

<h2>XIX. CONTENT.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>46. Harold and the Blind Man.</div>

<p>Do you know what it is to be contented? It is just the
opposite of being dissatisfied and unhappy.</p>

<p>Little Harold was looking forward to a day in the glen
on the morrow, but when the morning came it was wet and
cold, and the journey had to be put off. Harold had lots of
toys to play with, but he would not touch any of them; he
just stood with his face against the window-pane, discontented
and unhappy.</p>

<p>After a time he saw an old man with a stick coming up
the street, and a little dog was walking beside him. As
they drew nearer, Harold saw that the old man held the
dog by a string, and that it was leading him, for he was
blind. The discontented little boy began to wonder what
it must be like to be blind, and he shut his eyes very tight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to try it. How dark it was! he could see nothing. How
dreadful to be <b>always</b> in darkness! Then he opened his
eyes again, and looked at the old man's face; it was a
peaceful, pleasant face. The old man did not look discontented
and unhappy, and yet it was far worse to be blind
than to be disappointed of a picnic. Harold had yet to
learn that it is not <b>outside</b> things that give content, but
something within. He could not help being disappointed at
the wet day, but he could have made the best of it and
played with his toys, as indeed he did after seeing the
blind man.</p>

<h2>XX. TIDINESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>47. The Slovenly Boy.</div>

<p>Of <b>all</b> the untidy children you ever saw Leo must have
been the worst. His hair was unbrushed, his boots were
uncleaned, and the laces were always trailing on the floor.
Why did he not learn to tie a bow? (For full instructions,
with illustrations, on the "Tying of a bow," see <i>Games
Without Music</i>.) It must be very uncomfortable to have
one's boots all loose about the ankles, besides looking so
untidy.</p>

<p>Can you guess how his stockings were? They were all
in folds round his legs, instead of being drawn and held up
tight, and he had always a button off somewhere. The
worst of it was that Leo did not seem to <b>mind</b> being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
untidy. I hope <b>you</b> are not like that. Do all the little
girls love to have smooth, clean pinafores? and do the boys
like to have a clean collar and smooth hair? and do all
of you keep your hands and faces clean? Then you are
like the children in these verses.</p>

<p>1. The Tidy Boy:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>

<p>2. The Tidy Girl:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
And what about the tidy girl?<br />

<div class='sectiontitle'>48. Pussy and the Knitting.</div>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I've scarcely seen you</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">At all to-day.</span><br />

<div class='sectiontitle'>49. The Packing of the Trunks.</div>

<p>Nellie and Madge were two little girls getting ready to
go for a visit to grandmamma. She lived many miles away,
and the children were to go by train and stay with her
for a whole month.</p>

<p>Their clothes were all laid on the bed ready for packing,
and as mother wanted them to grow up <b>helpful</b> girls,
she said they might put the things in the boxes themselves.
So Nellie and Madge began to pack. Nellie took
each article by itself, and laid it carefully in the box
without creasing, putting all the heavier things at the
bottom, and the dresses and lighter articles at the top.
When she had laid them all in, the lid just closed nicely,
and her work was finished.</p>

<p>Then she turned to see what Madge was doing. Madge
had not packed more than half her pile, and the box was
full. "What shall I do?" she cried, "I <b>cannot</b> get them
all in." Just then mamma came up and said: "Have you
finished, children? it is nearly train time". Her eyes fell
on the box Madge was packing, and she exclaimed, "Oh!
Madge, you have put the clothes in anyhow, everything
must be taken out!" Madge had just thrown them in
"higgledy-piggledy," instead of laying them straight, and
they came out a crumpled heap. She was so hot and
flurried, and so afraid of being late for the train, that she
could hardly keep the tears back, but mamma and Nellie
helped to straighten the things, and to pack them neatly,
and just as the cab drove up to the door the last frock
was laid in the box, and the lid went down without any
trouble. Madge remembered to take more pains next
time she packed her box.</p>

<p>I was in a house one day, and when the lady opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
a drawer to get something out, the articles in the drawer
<b>bounced up</b> just like a "Jack in the box," because you
see, they had been put in anyhow, and then crushed
down to allow the drawer to be closed. Of course she
could not find what she wanted. I hope none of <b>your</b>
drawers are like a "Jack in the box". I wonder if
untidy people are lazy? I am afraid they are.</p>

<p>A girl came home from school one day, and threw her
wet cloak on a chair all in a heap, instead of hanging it
up nicely on a peg. When she next wanted to wear the
cloak, it was all over creases and not fit to put on. Perhaps
she thought that mother would see it on the chair,
and hang it up for her, but a nice, thoughtful child would
not like to give mother the trouble, would she?</p>

<h2>XXI. MODESTY.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>50. The Violet.</div>

<p>Two friends were walking along a country road, and as
they went on one said: "I do believe there are violets
somewhere on this bank, the air smells so sweet". The
other lady replied that she did not see any; but, looking
carefully, they at last found the leaves, and there, hiding
away among them, was the little sweet violet, with its
delicious scent.</p>

<p>Why does the little violet hide away? Because she is
<b>modest</b>, which means that she does not like to <b>boast</b>, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
make a display of her pretty petals and sweet perfume.
<b>Modest</b> people do not like to talk of kind, noble or clever
things they may have done; they prefer to <b>hide</b> their good
deeds, and in this they are like the violet.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>51. Modesty in Dress.</div>

<p>There is another way in which children can be modest&mdash;they
can be modest about dress. A child's dress is not so
long as that of a grown-up person, because children want
to romp and play about, but a <b>modest</b> child always likes
its dress to cover it nicely, and will take care that no
buttons are unfastened.</p>

<p>One evening some children were playing about on the
hearthrug, when one of them, a little girl named Jessie,
jumped up quite suddenly, and, with a blushing face, ran
out of the room. The governess followed to see what was
the matter, and Jessie told her in a whisper that she was
<b>so</b> ashamed, because in romping about her dress had gone
above her knees.</p>

<p>Some people might say that Jessie was <b>too</b> modest,
but I do not think so; a nice little girl will always like
to keep her knees covered.</p>

<p>In America the children have much longer dresses than
in our country, and they would think little girls very rude
who were not as careful as Jessie.</p>

<p>You will think for yourselves of many other ways in
which children can be modest. It is a good rule never
to do <b>anything</b> that we would be ashamed for teacher
or mother to see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXII. ON GIVING PLEASURE TO OTHERS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>52. "Selfless" and "Thoughtful"&mdash;a Fairy Tale.</div>

<p>"Selfless" and "Thoughtful" were sisters of the little
"Gold-wings" (<a href="#SL_1">Story Lesson 1</a>). I cannot tell you which
of the two was the sweetest and best; they were <b>both</b>
so lovable, for like "Gold-wings" they were always thinking
of others, and especially of how they could give pleasure
to the sick and weak. One day, as they sat on a mossy
bank in the Fairy wood, "Selfless" asked, "What shall we
do next, sister?" and "Thoughtful" made answer, "I have
been thinking of little Davie, who is so lame and weak;
suppose I go to the Kindergarten and try to get some one
to be kind to him". "A good idea," replied "Selfless,"
"and I will fly over the fields and see what can be done
there; then in the moonlight we will meet, and tell each
other what we have done." So they spread their pretty
wings and flew away.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Now it is night in the Fairy wood, and in the silver
moonlight the sisters rest again on the mossy bank and
talk.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>53. The Bunch of Roses.</div>

<p>"I flew to the Kindergarten," said "Thoughtful," "you
know Davie used to attend there before he was ill. Of
course no one saw me, and as I hovered over the teacher's
desk, little Bessie, a rosy-cheeked maid, came up and laid
a lovely bunch of crimson roses upon it for the teacher.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
The scent was so delicious I could not help nestling down
into one of the roses to enjoy it better. The teacher picked
up the flowers, not knowing I was there, and as she buried
her face in the soft petals, to smell the sweet perfume, I
whispered 'Send them to Davie'."</p>

<p>"A smile instantly came over her face, and she said:
'Bessie, a good fairy has whispered a kind thought to me;
shall we send your pretty roses to Davie?'"</p>

<p>"'Oh! yes,' said Bessie, 'please let me take them to
him with your love, for I gave them to you."</p>

<p>"So the roses were taken to Davie, and how happy they
made him to be sure! and the <b>teacher</b> was happy because
she had remembered poor Davie, and <b>Bessie</b> was happy to
carry the flowers to him, so I came away glad, also; but
what have <b>you</b> done, dear sister?"</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>54. Edwin and the Birthday Party.</div>

<p>Then "Selfless" answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I flew away over the fields, and there I saw a little boy,
dressed all in his best clothes, speeding away across the
field-path, and I knew that he was going to a birthday
party, and that he was walking quickly so as to be in time;
for there was to be a lovely birthday cake, all iced over with
sugar; and little pieces of silver, called threepenny pieces,
had been scattered through the cake, so of course Edwin
wanted to be there when it was cut up.</p>

<p>"I saw a little girl in the fields, also, walking along the
hedges looking for blackberries, and in trying to reach a
branch of the ripe fruit that grew on the farther side of a
ditch, the poor child overbalanced herself and fell in,
uttering a loud scream.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Edwin heard the scream and said to himself, 'I wonder
what that is? I should like to go and see, but oh, dear! it
will perhaps make me late for the party'. Then the Bad
Voice spoke to him, and said, 'Never mind the scream;
hurry on to the party," and Edwin hurried on, but his
cheeks grew hot, and he looked unhappy.</p>

<p>"Soon the child screamed again, and the Good Voice said,
'Help! Edwin, never mind self,' and with that he turned
back, and ran to the place where the sounds had seemed
to come from. He soon saw the little girl, who was trying
to scramble up the steep side of the ditch, and could not;
it needed the help of Edwin's strong hands to give her a good
pull, and bring her safely out. Oh, how glad she was to be
on the grass once more! Edwin wiped her tears away, and
told her to run home; then he made haste to the party with
a light, glad heart, and he arrived just as they were sitting
down to tea, so he was in time for the cake after all. But
even if he had <b>missed</b> it, he would have been glad that he
stayed behind to help the little girl."</p>

<p>"What a nice boy," said "Thoughtful". "Did he tell
the people at the party what he had done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <b>no</b>," replied "Selfless"; "his mother told him that
people should <b>never boast</b> of kind things they had done,
for that would spoil it."</p>

<p>"True," said "Thoughtful"; "but what did <b>you</b> do, dear
"Selfless"? It is not boasting to tell <b>me</b>."</p>

<p>"I only helped Edwin to listen to the Good Voice," replied
"Selfless," as she looked down on the moss at her
feet.</p>

<p>"A good work, too," said "Thoughtful"; "and now,
what shall we do next?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>55. Davie's Christmas Present.</div>

<p>"I have been thinking," said "Selfless," "that Christmas
will soon be here, and how nice it would be if we could
help the children at the Kindergarten to think of Davie, and
make ready a Christmas present for him."</p>

<p>"A lovely idea," said "<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Thoughful'">Thoughtful</ins> "; "we will go to-morrow,
for it wants only a month to Christmas."</p>

<p>Next morning the two fairy sisters came to the Kindergarten,
and floated about unseen, as fairies always do. First
they rested on the teacher, who was very fond of these
unseen fairies, and she began to think of Davie. "Children,"
said she, "Christmas will be here in a month; shall
we make a present for little Davie?"</p>

<p>(Do you know, I believe that doing kind things is like
going to parties; when you have been to <b>one</b> party, you
like it so much that you are glad to go to <b>another</b>, and
when you have done <b>one</b> kind thing, it makes you so happy
you want to do <b>another</b>.)</p>

<p>Bessie was the first to answer, and she said, "Oh, yes,
it would be lovely to make a Christmas present for Davie;
do let us try". And all the children said, "Yes, do let us
try".</p>

<p>"It must be something made by your own little hands,"
said the teacher. "Think now, what could you do?"</p>

<p>"We could make some little 'boats'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in paperfolding,"
said one child. Teacher said that would do nicely, and she
wrote it down.</p>

<p>Another child said, "I could sew a 'cat' in the embroidery
lesson," and Bessie exclaimed, "Please let me sew a 'kitten'
to go with it," and the teacher wrote that down, and remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that some one else might make the "saucer" for pussy's milk,
in pricking. Then others might make a "nest"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in clay with
eggs in it, and a little "bird" sitting on the eggs, suggested
the teacher; and as the "babies" begged to be allowed to help
also, it was decided that they should thread pretty coloured
beads on sticks, and make a nice large "basket".<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>"Now," said teacher, "I have quite a long list, and we
must begin at once." So they all set to work, and when
breaking-up day came, Davie's present was ready. There
was a whole fleet of "ships," white inside and crimson outside.
The pictures of "pussy" and her "kitten" were neatly sewn,
and the "saucer" was white and clean, and evenly pricked,
while the "bird" on its "nest" looked as pretty as could be,
and the "bead basket" was the best of all&mdash;at least the <b>babies</b>
thought so.</p>

<p>I have no words to tell of the joy that the children's
present brought to little Davie, his face flushed with pleasure
as the "boats" and other gifts were spread out before him; it
was so delightful to think that the children had remembered
<b>him</b> and <b>worked</b> for him.</p>

<p>"Selfless" and "Thoughtful" sat once more on the mossy
bank, and rejoiced that the plan had worked so well.</p>

<p>If these little fairies and their sister "Kindness" should ever
suggest thoughts to <b>you</b>, dear boys and girls, do not send
them away. They will speak to you through the Good
Voice, and the happiest people in the world are the people
who listen to the Good Voice.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>56. Why we should be Clean.</div>

<p>(Show the children a sponge.) Here is a sponge! What
do we see all over the sponge? We see little holes. There
is another name for these&mdash;we call them <b>pores</b>. (Write
"pores" on Blackboard.) What comes out on your forehead
sometimes on a hot day? Drops of water come out.
They come through tiny holes in the skin, so tiny that we
cannot see them, and these also are called pores.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, long, long ago, there was to be a grand
procession in a fine old city called Rome, and a little
golden-haired child was gilded all over his body to represent
"The Golden Age" in the procession. When it was over
the little child was soon dead. Can you guess why? The
pores in his skin had been all stopped up with the gilding,
so that the damp, warm air could not get out, and that
caused his death.</p>

<p>You see, then, that we breathe with these little pores,
just as we breathe with our nose and mouth, and if the
pores were all closed up we should die. Now you will
understand why we have to be washed and bathed. What
is it that the dirt does to your pores? It stops them up, so</p>

To be Healthy, We must be Clean.<br /></div>

<p>57. Little Creatures who like to be Clean.</p>

<p>You know that pussy likes to be clean, and that she
washes herself carefully, and her little kittens, also, until
they are big enough to wash themselves; but there are
other creatures, much smaller than the cat, who like to be
clean.</p>

<p>Do you know what shrimps or prawns are? I daresay
you have often eaten a shrimp! Have you ever counted
its ten long legs? On the front pair there are two tiny
brushes, and the prawn has been seen to stand up on his
eight hind legs, and brush himself with the tiny tufts on his
front legs, to get all the sand away. Is not that clever for
such a little fellow?</p>

<p>There is another creature, very much smaller than the
prawn, that is particularly clean, though we do not like to
have it in our houses.</p>

<p>If the housemaid sees its little "parlour" in the corner of
a room, she sweeps it away. You remember who it was
that said: "Will you walk into my parlour?" It was the
spider, and it is the spider who is so very fond of being
clean, that it cannot bear to have a grain of dust anywhere
about its body. Its hairs and legs are always kept perfectly
clean.</p>

<p>Then there is the tiny ant, which is smaller than a fly,
and it loves to keep itself nice and clean, so if</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>58. The Boy who did not like to be Washed.</div>

<p>Sydney was a little boy who did not like to be washed.
He disliked it as much as the little dog in Story Lesson
<a href="#SL_4">No. 4</a>. When the time came for his bath he screamed
and kicked and made such a fuss that at last his mother
said he should remain dirty for a while, and see what
would happen. So Sydney had no bath when he went to
bed at night, neither was he washed in the morning. Of
course no one wanted to kiss him, or play with him, for
he was not sweet and clean; he had to play all by
himself in the garden.</p>

<p>Presently a carriage drove up and stopped at the garden
gate; then a gentleman stepped out, walked up to the door,
and rang the bell, which was answered by Sydney's mother.</p>

<p>"I have called to take your little boy for a drive," said
the gentleman, "but I am in a great hurry; could you have
him ready at once?"</p>

<p>Just then Sydney peeped in at the door. Oh! what a
little blackamoor he was, not fit for any one to see! His
mother had to explain to the kind gentleman how it was
that he looked so dirty, and, as nothing but a bath and
a whole suit of clean clothes would make him fit to go,
he had to be left behind. Poor Sydney began to feel very
sad and sorry now, and when the carriage had driven away
he ran up to his mother, hid his little black face in her
dress, and burst into tears. "Oh, mother," he cried, "do
make me a clean boy again; I will never be naughty any
more when I am washed." Sydney never forgot the lesson
he had learnt that</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>59. The Nails and the Teeth.</div>

<p>What a good thing it is that we have nice, hard nails to
keep the tips of our fingers from being hurt! How sore
they would get if it were not for those bright, horny
nails, and how well they protect the finger-tips, which
have to touch so many things!</p>

<p>Most of the nail is fast to the finger, but at the outer edge
there is a little space <b>between</b> the nail and the finger, and
if we are not careful this little space gets filled with dirt,
and then the nail has a black band across the top, which
looks very ugly. When the nails are long, the band is
wider, and, although the dirt is <b>under</b> the nail, it shows
on the outside, because the nail is transparent, that is, it
can be seen through.</p>

<p>Do you like to have your hands clean? Then there must
be no black bands to disfigure the pretty, shining nails; our
hands cannot be called clean if there is a little arch of dirt
at the tip of each finger. Ask mother to cut the nails
when they get too long, then you can keep them clean
more easily.</p>

<p>Men who do work that soils their hands very much like
the chimney-sweep (<a href="#SL_62">Story Lesson 62</a>) cannot possibly keep
their nails clean, but children can.</p>

<p>There was once a little boy who had the funniest finger-tips
I ever saw. The nails were so short that there was
not the tiniest space between the outer edge and the fleshy
part, and so the tip of each finger had grown out like a little
round cushion, not at all pretty to look at. If the little boy
saw any one noticing his hands, he would hide them away,
lest he should be asked what it was that caused the finger-tips
to look so funny. I wonder if <b>you</b> can guess the
reason? It was because the boy bit his nails. What a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
horrid thing to do! Was it not? And how do you think
his mother cured him? She dipped the tips of his fingers
in tincture of bitter aloes, so that when he put them in
his mouth he might get the bitter taste, and leave off
biting them.</p>

<p>I once heard a gentleman say that <b>he</b> thought it was
very rude to put a pencil or anything near the mouth, so
what would he think of a child who put his <b>fingers</b> in
his mouth, and bit his nails? Baby may suck her little
thumb sometimes, perhaps, because she does not know
better, but sensible children will remember that it is rude
to put fingers in mouth.</p>

<div class='blackboard'>(Blackboard.)<br />


Keep your Nails Clean.<br />
Do not put Fingers in Mouth.<br /></div>


<p>Can you think of anything else that should be kept clean
besides the nails? In your mouth are two rows of beautiful
little, white teeth. At least they <b>ought</b> to be white, but if
we do not keep them clean, they often get discoloured and
begin to decay and give us pain.</p>

<p>We should each have a tooth-brush, and use it every day
to cleanse the teeth, dipping it first in nice, clean water, and
when the brushing is done, the mouth should be rinsed
several times. The teeth should be brushed up and down
from the gums (not from left to right), so that we may get
all the particles of food from the tiny spaces between the
teeth. If we do this regularly we shall not be likely to
suffer much from toothache.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXIV. PURE LANGUAGE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>60. Toads and Diamonds&mdash;A Fairy Tale.</div>

<p>There was an old woman at a well, who, when a little
girl came to draw water, asked for a drink, and the kind
little maiden lifted the jug to the old woman's lips, and
told her to take as much as she wished. Then the old
woman blessed her for her kindness, and said that whenever
the child spoke, pearls and diamonds should fall from
her lips. Then another girl came to the well, and again
the old woman asked to drink, but the girl said, "No!
draw water for yourself". That was rude and unkind,
was it not?</p>

<p>The old woman, who was really the Queen of the
Fairies, could not bless <b>this</b> girl for her kindness, because
she had showed none, so she said that whenever the girl
spoke, toads and vipers should fall from her lips. That
is like the people who do not speak good, pure language;
the bad words that fall from their lips are like toads and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
vipers. I hope you have never heard such words, but if
you ever should, do not stop to listen, for wicked words
are like the pitch that Martin tried to play with (<a href="#SL_63">Story
Lesson 63</a>); the person who says them cannot be pure and
true, for bad words are not <b>clean</b>.</p>

<p>A lady was travelling in a railway train one day, and
several young men were in the carriage, who spoke and
looked like gentlemen. But by-and-by they began to
swear dreadfully, and the lady asked if they would be
kind enough to say the bad words in Greek or Latin, so
that she could not understand them. She did not want
to hear the bad words, you see; they were like toads and
vipers to her, because she loved what was pure and clean.</p>

<h2>XXV. PUNCTUALITY.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>61. Lewis and the School Picnic.</div>

<p>There was once a little boy called Lewis, who had one
bad fault&mdash;he was very, very slow; so slow, that I am
afraid he was really lazy. He could do his sums quite well,
but he was always the last boy to get them finished; and in
a morning his mother had no end of trouble to get him off
to school in time, he did everything so slowly. (Read the
following sentence very deliberately, and allow the children
to fill in the adverbs): He got out of bed (slowly), dressed
himself (slowly), washed himself (slowly), laced his boots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
(slowly), ate his breakfast (slowly), and walked to school at
the same pace (slowly).</p>

<p>Now one day a gentleman came to the school, and told
the teacher that he was going to take all the children in a
boat down the river to have a picnic by the seaside. Could
anything be more delightful? The scholars clapped their
hands for gladness, and talked and thought of nothing but
the picnic. It was to be on the very next day, and they
were to start from the school at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"Lewis," said the teacher, "remember to be in time, for
the boat will not wait!"</p>

<p>The morning came, and Lewis was called by his mother
at seven o'clock. "There is plenty of time," said Lewis,
"I will lie a little longer;" and he did so. Then his
mother called again, and this time he rose, but he went
through all his work as slowly as ever, and all the time his
mother was telling him to "hurry up" or he would be too
late.</p>

<p>At last he is ready to start; but just as he leaves the
house a bell is rung. "What is that?" says Lewis; "it
must be the bell of the steamer. I have no time to go round
by the school; I must go straight to the pier," and off he
ran. But, alas! by the time he reached the pier the boat
was steaming off. He could see the children with their
pails and spades waving their handkerchiefs in glee, and
there was he left behind!</p>

<p>I was telling this story to a little boy once, and when it
came to this part he said: "Oh, auntie! could not they get
a little boat and take Lewis to the steamer? It is so hard
for him to be left behind."</p>

<p>But you see, boys and girls, we <b>must</b> be left behind, if
we are slow and lazy.</p>

<p>I am glad to tell you, however, that Lewis was cured of
his fault by this disappointment. He really did try to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
on more quickly afterwards, and he succeeded. At school
he had his sums finished so soon that the teacher began to
let him help the other boys who did not get on so well, and
Lewis was quite proud and happy. Then he came to school
so early that he was made "monitor," and had to put out
the slates and books, ready for the others. So, after all,
Lewis grew up to be smart and quick, and not like the man
you will hear of in another story (<a href="#SL_84">Story Lesson 84</a>), who
grew worse as he grew older.</p>

<h2>XXVI. ALL WORK HONOURABLE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_62" id="SL_62"></a>62. The Chimney-sweep.</div>

<p>"Mother," said little Frank, "I saw a man walking along
the street to-day with a bundle of brushes in his hand, and
such a black face. I was careful not to touch him as I
passed, he looked so dirty&mdash;quite a 'blackamoor'"!</p>

<p>"Ah!" said his mother, "that was a chimney-sweep; he
cannot <b>help</b> being dirty, and my little boy ought to feel very
kindly to him, for we should be badly off without such
men."</p>

<p>Not many days afterwards there was a storm. How the
wind blew and roared! All through the night it rattled the
windows and whistled in the chimney. Frank's mother
went downstairs early in the morning to make a fire, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
as soon as she lighted it, puff! the smoke came down the
chimney, and filled the room, and she was obliged to let the
fire go out.</p>

<p>Down came the children for breakfast, and Frank cried:
"Is the fire not lighted, mother? I am so cold; and oh!
the house <b>is</b> smoky."</p>

<p>"I have tried to light a fire," said his mother, "but the
smoke blows down the chimney. I think it needs sweeping;
I shall have to give you milk for breakfast; there is no
nice, hot coffee for you, because the fire will not burn."</p>

<p>After breakfast Frank's brother went to fetch the chimney-sweep,
who soon came, and with his long brushes brought
down all the soot, which he carried away in a bag. Then
the fire burned merrily, making the room look quite bright
and cheerful, and Frank said: "Thank you, Mr. Chimney-sweep,
for your good work. I will never call you 'blackamoor'
again; and when I meet you in the street, I will not
think you are too dirty to speak to."</p>

<p>Frank had learnt two lessons:&mdash;</p>

<div class='blackboard'>(Blackboard)</div><div class='poem2'>

<b>2. We must be kind to these Men, for we Need their Work.</b><br /></div>

<h2>XXVII. BAD COMPANIONS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_63" id="SL_63"></a>63. Playing with Pitch.</div>

<p>You have seen the men at work mending the roads,
and you know how sometimes they spread little stones
all over the road, and then roll them flat with a steam-roller.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
But in some places the roads are laid with stones
as large as bricks, and when these have all been placed
together, the men take a large can with a spout, full of
hot pitch, and pour it into the spaces between the stones
to fasten them together.</p>

<p>A little boy, named Martin, was watching the men do
this one day, and he said to himself, "I should like a
piece of that black stuff; it has cooled now, and looks
like a black piece of dough; I could make all sorts of
shapes with it, and I do not believe it would soil my
hands". So he picked up a length that lay near him,
rolled it into a ball, and put it in his pocket. Some of
the tar stuck to his hands, and when he washed them
it did not come off, but it was now school time, and away
he went. When he came out of school, he put his hand
in his pocket to get the tar, and oh, what a sticky mess
it was! His pocket was all over tar, so was his hand,
and when he reached home, his mother set to work to get
it off, and it took her a long, long time.</p>

<p>Martin was mistaken in thinking he could play with the
pitch and not get soiled.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>64. Stealing Strawberries.</div>

<p>When Martin grew older he had some playmates who
were not very good, and his mother said, "Martin, I wish
you would not play with those boys; I fear they will get
you into trouble".</p>

<p>"Oh! no, mother," replied Martin, "if they <b>wanted</b>
me to do anything wrong I would not; I need not learn
their bad ways if I <b>do</b> play with them." But his mother
shook her head, for she knew better.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the boys had a half-holiday, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Martin went with his friends into the country. Presently
they came to a large garden, with a high wall round it,
and the boys began to climb the wall.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Martin.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said one of the boys, laughing, "a friend of ours
owns this garden, and we are going to help him gather
strawberries."</p>

<p>There was a large bed of strawberries on the other side
of the wall, and as soon as the boys were over, they began
to pick and eat.</p>

<p>What the boy had told Martin was quite untrue&mdash;they
were <b>stealing</b> the strawberries; but before very long the
gardener spied them, and with one or two other men came
upon them so quietly, that they had no time to get away,
and every boy was made prisoner. The gardener locked
them up in the tool-house until the owner came, and he
took their names and addresses, and said they should be
brought before the magistrates, as it was not the first time
they had stolen his fruit. Of course Martin had not been
with them the other times, but he was caught with them
now, and can you imagine how dreadfully ashamed he
felt, and how his cheeks burned when he thought of his
dear mother, and the trouble it would be to her. When
he reached home, he told his mother all that had happened,
and begged her forgiveness. His mother was
greatly distressed, and said: "You remember playing with
the pitch, Martin, when you were a very little boy&mdash;you
thought you could handle it, and still keep clean, but you
could not; so neither can you have bad companions
without being mixed up in wrong-doing".</p>

<h2>XXVIII. ON FORGETTING.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>65. Maggie's Birthday Present.</div>

<p>It was Maggie's birthday, and her father brought her as
a present something that she had been wishing for a very
long time. It was a beautiful yellow canary, and its little
house was the prettiest cage imaginable, for it was made of
brass wire, which was so bright that you could almost think
it was gold. Of course Maggie was delighted. "It is just
what I have been wishing for," said she; "I shall feed the
canary myself, and give it fresh water every day; it is the
prettiest bird I ever saw."</p>

<p>For some weeks Maggie remembered her little pet each
day, and attended to all its wants, but there came a day
when there was to be a picnic for all the school children,
and Maggie was so excited and glad about the picnic that
she forgot all about feeding the bird.</p>

<p>Then next day there was hay-making, and she was in
the field all day, and again forgot the poor bird.</p>

<p>This went on for a few days, and when at last she <b>did</b>
remember, and went to the cage, the bird was dead.</p>

<p>Maggie was full of grief, and cried until her head ached,
but she could not undo the results of her forgetting.</p>

<p>Some people think it is a <b>little</b> fault to forget, but that
cannot be, for we know well that "forgetting" often causes
pain and suffering to others.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>66. The Promised Drive.</div>

<p>Daniel was a lame little boy. He could not walk at all,
nor play about with the other children, so he was very puny
and pale. His mother used to put his little chair near the
door of the cottage where they lived, so that he could watch
the people pass, and one day, as he sat there, a lady came
by with a well-dressed little boy, and when she saw the
pale-faced child she stopped and spoke to him, and then
Daniel's mother came to the door, and invited her to step
inside the cottage.</p>

<p>The lady's little boy was called Emil, and he stood on
the doorstep talking to Daniel, while the two mothers spoke
together within the cottage. Emil, who was a kind-hearted
little fellow, felt very sorry for the lame child, and when he
found that Daniel was never able to go any farther than the
street where he lived, Emil said: "I will ask my father to
bring his carriage round and take you for a drive; I am sure
he will, and then you can see the green fields and trees, and
hear the birds sing".</p>

<p>Daniel's little face flushed with pleasure, and he said;
"Oh that would be lovely!"</p>

<p>By-and-by the lady and her boy said "Good-bye," and
went away, and then Daniel told his mother all that Emil
had said. "Do you think he will come to-morrow, mother?"
asked Daniel.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not to-morrow, dear," replied she, "but some
day soon maybe."</p>

<p>So Daniel sat at the door each day, and waited for the
carriage, but it never came, and when he grew too ill to
sit up he would still lie and listen for the sound of the
wheels, and say: "I think it will come to-day, mother,"
but it never did. And do you know why? Emil had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
forgotten to ask his father, and so Daniel waited in vain
for the drive.</p>

<p>You see how much pain and disappointment can be
caused by forgetting, and when you promise to do a thing
and forget to <b>keep</b> the promise it is just like telling an
untruth. You do not <b>intend</b> to speak what is not the
truth, but you do it all the same. Remember, then, that
it is <b>not</b> a little fault to forget, and that those who do it
are not building on the firm foundation of truth.</p>

promises to adults (and it is in reality nothing less than untruth),
it is infinitely worse to break faith with children. An unredeemed
promise is a sure way of shaking a child's confidence in truth and
goodness. Let us keep our word with the little ones at whatever
cost.</p></div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>67. The Boy who Remembered.</div>

<p>Little Elsie had a big brother called Jack, of whom she
was very fond, and he was fond of Elsie also. Jack was
about fifteen years old, and he was learning to be a sailor.
When his ship came into port he used to come home for
a few days, and then he would tell Elsie all about the
places he had seen. One time the voyage had been very
long, and Jack told Elsie that when the bread was all
finished they had had to eat sea-biscuits instead.</p>

<p>"How funny," said Elsie; "what are sea-biscuits like,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"They are very hard and round and thick," replied Jack.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsie said she would like to see one, and Jack promised
that when he went back to his ship he would send her one.</p>

<p>It was not a great thing to promise, was it? But Elsie
felt very important when the postman brought her a little
parcel a day or two after Jack had left, and she was
very glad when she opened it and found the promised
biscuit.</p>

<p>"There is one good thing about Jack," exclaimed Elsie,
"he always does what he says." I think Jack would have
been pleased to hear Elsie say that; it is one of the nicest
things that <b>could</b> have been said about him. I hope it is
true of all of us.</p>

<h2>XXIX. KINDNESS TO ANIMALS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>68. Lulu and the Sparrow.</div>

<p>As Lulu came home from school one afternoon, she
noticed three or four boys throwing stones at something&mdash;I
hardly like to <b>tell</b> you what. It was a poor little
brown sparrow that had somehow hurt its leg, and could
not fly. However, this happened a great many years ago,
and perhaps boys are less cruel now.</p>

<p>Lulu could not bear to see the poor bird treated so badly,
and she asked the boys to give it to her. At first they
laughed, and went on throwing the stones; but she continued
to beg for it so earnestly, that at last one of the boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
said, "Let her have it". And Lulu was only too glad to
pick up the wounded bird and carry it home. She nursed
and fed it carefully, and put it in a warm place by the fire;
but, in spite of all her care, the sparrow died in a few
hours.</p>

<p>Sometimes pain is necessary, as in <a href="#SL_29">Story Lesson 29</a>; we
should never think of saying the dentist was cruel; rather
we should say he was kind, because he saved the monkey
from <b>further</b> pain. But when we cause pain that is <b>needless</b>,
as these boys did, it is <b>cruel</b>. They were cowardly
also. If the bird had been an eagle, with strong claws that
could have hurt them in return, would they have stoned it?
No; they chose a poor little sparrow that could not defend
itself, and this was <b>cowardly</b>.</p>

<p>Then it was <b>unfair</b>. You do not like to be punished or
found fault with if you have done nothing wrong; you feel
it is not fair; neither is it fair to hurt a dumb animal that
has done nothing wrong.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>69. Why we should be Kind to Animals.</div>

<p>Just think how many things animals do for us. Where
did the wool come from that makes your nice, warm clothes?
(Let children answer.) How do we get the coals to our
houses&mdash;the coals that make the bright, hot fires? (Ans.)
What could we do without the brave, strong horses? I
heard the other day of a man who did not give his horse
enough to eat. What kind of man was he? (Ans.) I
would rather be like the Arab, who loves his horse so much
that he brings it into his tent, and shares his food and bed
with it. Where do we get our milk, butter and cheese?
(Ans.) Then think of all the stories of animals in this book,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
who have done kind, clever things (and all these stories are
true). If boys and girls would <b>think</b>, I am quite sure they
would never be unkind to animals.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>70. The Butterfly.</div>

<p>One day a boy was chasing a butterfly, cap in hand, and
just as he had caught it, a bee stung him. He was so angry
that he threw the butterfly down and trampled on it. Was
not that cruel? The butterfly had done him no harm, and
the greatest skill in the world could not paint anything so
delicate and beautiful as a butterfly's wing; and yet he
destroyed that beauty. Sometimes children will hunt spiders
out of the crevices in the wall and torture them, and others
will torment the little fly, or steal the bird's pretty eggs
that the mother sits on with such care. All this is cruel
and unkind. Remember it is <b>not noble</b> to hurt. The
truest gentleman is he who is full of kindness and gentleness
and will not hurt anything.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>71. The Kind-hearted Dog.</div>

<p>Have you ever seen children riding donkeys at the seaside?
and have you noticed how the boys beat the poor
things sometimes to make them go faster? I do not think
a <b>kind</b> boy or girl would like to have a donkey beaten. I
hope <b>you</b> would not.</p>

<p>There was once a little dog who could not bear to see
any creature beaten. If any one were ill-treating a dog he
would rush up and bark quite angrily, and when he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
driving in the dog-cart with his master, he always used to
hold the sleeve of his master's coat every time he touched
the horse with the whip, as if he would have said, "Do
not beat him, please". Now, if a <b>dog</b> knows that it is
not kind to hurt dumb creatures, we are sure boys and girls
know.</p>

<h2>XXX. BAD TEMPER.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_72" id="SL_72"></a>72. How Paul was Cured.</div>

<p>Paul was a little boy who was very fond of having his
own way, and when he could not get it he used to throw
himself into the most dreadful tempers. He would take
his pocket-handkerchief and tear it all to pieces in his rage,
not to mention lying on the floor and kicking with his heels.
One day his governess said to him, "Paul, I will tell you a
true story". Paul sat down ready to listen, for he loved
stories, so the governess began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was once a little boy, bright, honest and truthful,
always ready to run messages for his mother, or to help a
schoolmate with his lessons, he was so good-natured. But
Henry (for that was his name) had one great fault&mdash;he
would get into violent passions when any one vexed him,
and as he grew older his passion became stronger, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the mastery of him more and more. He was a sailor, and
as time went on he had a ship of his own, and was captain
of it. Henry could manage the ship well; he knew just
how to turn the wheel to make her go East or West, and
he knew also how to trim the sails to make the ship move
swiftly along. If he could have controlled his temper as he
did his ship, all might have been well. But he used to be
very angry with the sailors when they did not please him,
and one day when the cabin-boy had done something that
vexed him, the captain in a fit of passion beat the poor boy
so cruelly that he died. When the ship came home the
captain was taken to prison, and in the end he lost <b>his</b> life
for having taken the boy's life."</p>

<p>The governess paused, and Paul gazed up into her face
with wide-open, anxious eyes. "Is <b>that</b> what happens to
boys who get into a passion?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It happened to the captain," said she.</p>

<p>"Then I will never give way to passion again if it has
such a dreadful ending," said Paul, and the governess told
me that he kept his word.</p>

<div class='blackboard'>(Blackboard.)<br />
If Bad Temper gets the Mastery, it leads to sad Results.<br /></div>



<div class='sectiontitle'>73. The Young Horse.</div>

<p>Edgar was riding in the train with his mother one day.
He sat next the window, as children like to do, so that he
could see all that was going on. How the train speeds
along! now passing through a tunnel, then out again into
the sunshine; next it goes over a long row of arches built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
across a valley, and called a viaduct. "How high up we
seem to be," said Edgar; "see, mother, the river is down
there ever so far below!" Now they are passing through
fields again, and there, looking over the hedge, is a beautiful
young horse. But as the train whirls by, the horse runs
off and scampers round and round the field. Edgar
watched him as long as he could see, and then he said:
"What a lovely horse, mother! how I should like to ride
him!"</p>

<p>"The horse is of no use for riding yet, Edgar," said his
mother.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Edgar.</p>

<p>"Because he has not yet learnt to obey a rider," replied
she; "the horse has to wear bit and bridle before he can be
of use, and to learn by them to be controlled. A horse that
could not be managed would run away with you, just as
poor Henry's temper ran away with him (<a href="#SL_72">Story Lesson 72</a>)."</p>

<p>Bad tempers and bad habits are like wild horses: they
take us where they will, and get us into sad trouble if we do
not bridle them, so we must take care <b>not</b> to let the temper
be master, but bridle it just as the horse-trainer bridles the
horse.</p>

<p>"I should think the horse does not like the bit and bridle
at first," said Edgar.</p>

<p>"Very likely not," replied his mother; "but he would
not be the useful, patient animal that he is if he did not
submit."</p>

<h2>XXXI. SELFISHNESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>74. The Child on the Coach.</div>

<p>It was summer, and we were riding on the top of the
coach through one of the loveliest parts of Scotland. The
coach had five seats with four persons on each, so you may
easily find out how many people there were. On the next
seat to ours sat a lady with a little spoilt boy, about four
years of age, who was very hard to please, and very discontented
and unhappy. You will not be much surprised
to hear that presently he began to cry, for spoilt children
often do that, but I do not think you could ever guess the
<b>reason</b>. His mother was speaking to a lady on the seat
behind, and when the child was asked, "What is the
matter?" he said, "Mamma is not attending to me when
I speak to her," and <b>that</b> was why he cried. He wanted
his mother to attend to <b>him</b>, to speak to him all the time,
and that was selfish. He was only a very little child, but
he thought too much of that ugly word&mdash;<b>self</b>, and that was
why he was so discontented and unhappy.</p>

<p>I knew another little child who was always wanting some
one to play with her; she never tried to amuse herself, but
was continually teasing her mother to join in her games.
It is better to be like little Elsie (<a href="#SL_21">Story Lesson 21</a>) who
when only a year old thought of the comfort of others.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>75. Edna and the Cherries.</div>

<p>One day a lady called at a cottage where there lived a
little girl, named Edna, who was playing on the hearth-rug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
with another little girl, Lizzie. The lady had come to see
Edna's grandmamma, but she had not forgotten that Edna
lived there, and she brought out of her basket a little paper
bag full of ripe cherries, and gave them to the child. Edna
did not forget to say "thank you," then she took the
little bag, put it on a chair, and peeped inside; she was
only two years old, and could not have reached the table.
As soon as she saw the pretty, red cherries, she toddled to
her little friend, and holding out the bag, said, "Lizzie
some". When Lizzie had taken a handful, she went to
her grandmother, and said, "Grandmamma some," and then
with a shy, little glance at the lady, she placed the bag in
her lap, and said, "Lady some".</p>

<p>Last of all she helped her dear little self, and so we say
that Edna was <b>un</b>selfish, that means <b>not</b> selfish. Baby
Edna did not know about the Temple we all have to make,
but she was building it just the same. Perhaps "Selfless"
and "Thoughtful" were helping her to find the stones!</p>

<div class='blackboard'>(Blackboard.)<br />
Think First of Others, Last of Self.<br /></div>




<div class='sectiontitle'>76. The Boy who liked always to Win.</div>

<p>We all like to win when we play games, and that is
quite right, but Johnny liked <b>so much</b> to win that he
was cross and unhappy if any one else was winning, and
did not enjoy the game at all; I am afraid that he even
cheated sometimes to win. Now all that was downright
selfish; it reminds one of a story&mdash;a sort of fairy-tale&mdash;about
Minerva and Arachne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Arachne said to Minerva, "Let us see who can spin
the best". So they began to spin, and when Minerva
saw that Arachne was beating her at the spinning, she
struck her on the head with a spindle, and turned poor
Arachne into a spider. It is a pity when people are so
anxious to win that it makes them selfish.</p>

<p>Selfishness is an ugly stone to have in your Temple,
dear children. Just as Thoughtfulness is one of the most
beautiful stones, so Selfishness is one of the ugliest. Try
not to let it come into your lives at all. No one likes a
selfish child, but everybody loves the child who <b>forgets</b>
self and thinks of others.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_77" id="SL_77"></a>77. The two Boxes of Chocolate.</div>

<p>It was Christmas time, and on Christmas Eve the
children hung up their stockings as usual. Next morning
they were awake early, and eagerly turned out the stockings
to see what they contained. Among other things Horace
and Stanley found that they each had a beautiful large
picture-box full of lovely chocolate creams.</p>

<p>After dinner on Christmas Day Stanley brought out his
box, and handed it round to everybody, and by the next
day his chocolates were all finished.</p>

<p>But Horace hid his box away in a drawer, and kept
going to it, and taking out a few at a time, so his
chocolates lasted much longer than Stanley's, and he ate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
them all himself, but we are obliged to say that he was
rather selfish. "Shared joy is double joy," and of the
two boys we are sure that Stanley would be the happier.</p>

<p>Shall I tell you a little secret? Selfishness will spoil
the <b>other</b> stones if you let it come into your Temple, and
as to the <b>gold</b>&mdash;the lovely gold of "Kindness" that the little
"Gold-wings" brought&mdash;Selfishness will <b>eat it all away</b>
in time. I am sure we all hate selfishness; let us write
down</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>78. Eva.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></div>

<p>Eva was not a very big girl, and her boots were generally
cleaned by the older ones, but one day her mother said,
"Eva, I wish you would brush your own boots this
morning, we are all so busy".</p>

<p>"Oh mother!" said Eva, "you know it gives me a
headache to brush boots, and I shall make my hands
so dirty, and perhaps bespatter the floor with blacking
as well." I am afraid Eva was rather a spoilt little girl,
and this had made her somewhat selfish.</p>

<p>Half an hour later her mother came into the room again,
just as Eva was lacing up her boots, and she inquired
who had made them so bright and shiny. It was Eva's
elder sister, Mary, and Eva knew that her mother was
not pleased, but nothing more was said.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>In the afternoon Mary and her mother went out shopping,
and Eva hurried home from school, although she
would have liked very much to stay for a while and play
with the other girls. But she wanted to give mother a
surprise. First she put the kettle on the fire, and then
she laid the table all neatly and nicely, ready for tea.
When everything was in its place, she went to the door
several times to look for her mother and sister; at last she
saw they were just turning the corner of the street, and
Eva ran along to meet them, and said, "Come away,
mother, tea is quite ready; I have been looking for you
and Mary ever so long". And dear mother knew what
it all meant.</p>

<p>It meant that Eva had been listening to the Good Voice,
and that she was sorry she had been so selfish in the
morning. The Good Voice says</p>

<h2>XXXII. CARELESSNESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_79" id="SL_79"></a>79. The Misfortunes of Elinor.</div>

<p>Elinor was a great anxiety to her mother, for she was
always either tearing her clothes, or forgetting, or losing
something&mdash;all because she was so careless. One day at
tea Elinor was taking the cup which her mother had just
filled, but as she was not looking at it, nor taking any care,
it tilted over and fell against a tall flower-vase that stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in the centre of the table. The vase was broken, and the
tablecloth deluged with tea and water&mdash;all for want of a
little care.</p>

<p>Another day Elinor's mother gave her a shilling, and
sent her to the shop for some fruit, but she lost the money,
and returned empty-handed.</p>

<p>Coming home from school one day, she was poking her
umbrella about in a little stream of water that the rain
had made along the side of the road, when the tip of the
stick caught in a grate and broke off, so the umbrella was
spoilt. I could tell you many more things about poor
careless Elinor, but these are enough to show how bad it
is not to take care. Sometimes people have taken poison
instead of medicine by being careless, and not noticing the
label on the bottle; and sometimes a train has been wrecked,
and lives lost, because the engine-driver was careless about
noticing the signal.</p>

<h2>XXXIII. ON BEING OBSTINATE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>80. How Daisy's Holiday was Spoilt.</div>

<p>Daisy's aunt had invited her to go and spend the day
with her cousin Violet, and to Daisy, who lived in the town,
it was a very great treat; for Violet's father and mother
lived at a farm, and when Daisy went there, the two little
girls spent the whole day out in the open air, climbing on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the hay, playing "hide and seek" in the barn, or helping
to milk the cows. The last time Daisy went to the farm,
however, she had taken cold, and her mother found that she
had been playing without coat and hat, so on this occasion
she said, "Daisy, I want you to promise me that you will
keep your outdoor things on when you are playing with
Violet, for the day is cold".</p>

<p>Daisy did not answer, and when her mother again asked
her, she would not promise. The omnibus which was to
take Daisy to the farm would pass at nine o'clock, and the
time was drawing near, but still Daisy was self-willed and
would not give in. (Oh, Daisy! that is <b>not</b> the Good Voice
you are listening to, you will be sorry afterwards.) The
omnibus came rumbling down the street, and Daisy sprang
up ready to go.</p>

<p>"Do you promise, Daisy?" asked her mother; "I cannot
let you go unless you do;" but Daisy was still obstinate, and
the omnibus went quickly past. A minute after she burst
into tears, and cried, "I <b>will</b> promise, mother," but by this
time the omnibus was too far on its way, and there was
not another until two o'clock. At this time Daisy was
allowed to go, but what a pity that she should lose half
a day's pleasure, and disappoint her cousin, as well as
grieving her dear mother, all for the sake of wanting her own
way. You remember what we said about mother knowing
best in "Obedience" (<a href="#SL_6">Story Lesson 6</a>). When we are
obstinate, we want to please <b>ourselves</b> instead of some one
else, so you can see that</p>

<h2>XXXIV. GREEDINESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>81. Stephen and the Buns.</div>

<p>It was breaking-up day at school, and the children were
having buns and tea. Each child had brought a clean
pocket-handkerchief, and spread it on the desk for a tablecloth.
Then the teacher gave out the buns; nice large buns
they were, with sugar on the top, and there were just a few
left over, after one had been given to each child. Next a
cup of tea was placed on each desk, and the tea-party went
on merrily.</p>

<p>But why does Stephen take such large bites, and fill his
mouth so full? And why is he eating so quickly? See,
his bun is finished now, and he is asking for another!
"Oh! Stephie, naughty boy, you have gobbled up your
bun as fast as you could, because you were afraid the buns
left over would be used up before you asked for more. That
was <b>greedy</b>."</p>

<p>Do not be greedy, boys and girls. Never mind how
hungry you are; eat slowly and nicely, and pass things to
others. It is so selfish to think only of your <b>own</b> wants, and
not to care how other people are getting on. "Greediness"
is an ugly word, and no one likes to see greedy children.</p>

<h2>XXXV. BOASTING.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>82. The Stag and his Horns.</div>

<p>Have you ever seen a stag with its graceful, branching
horns?</p>

<p>There is a fable told of a stag who went to a pool to
drink, and seeing himself reflected in the water, he said:
"Dear me, how beautiful are my horns; what a nice,
graceful appearance they give to me! My legs are quite
slender, and not at all beautiful, but my horns are handsome."
When the hunters came, however, the stag found
that his slender legs were very useful, for by means of
them he could run away from his enemies, and if it had
not been that his horns caught in the branches of a tree
and held him fast, he might have escaped.</p>

<p>You see how foolish it was of the stag to <b>boast</b> about
his fine horns; and we are just as foolish when <b>we</b> boast
of anything that we have, or of anything we can do.</p>

<p>Boasting often leads to untruth, as in (<a href="#SL_11">Story Lesson 11</a>)
"The Three Feathers". It is always vulgar to pretend
that we are better than our neighbours, and people who
boast generally try to make one believe that they <b>are</b>
cleverer or richer or better than somebody else. Let us
be like the modest violet, who hides her beauty, rather
than be boastful and foolish, as the stag was.</p>

<h2>XXXVI. WASTEFULNESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>83. The Little Girl who was Lost.</div>

<p>A little girl wandered away from home one morning and
got lost in a wood. She tried in vain to find the way home
again, but she could not, and then she sat down and cried,
for she was so tired, and oh! <b>so</b> hungry. She thought of
the many crusts of bread and pieces of meat that she had
often left on her plate at home, and how glad she would
have been to eat them now. It was evening when her
friends found her, and took her safely home; we will hope
that she remembered that hungry day in the woods, and
did not waste any more pieces of bread afterwards.</p>

<p>If you think of the many poor people who have scarcely
enough to eat, you will see how wrong it is to waste
anything. When we have more than we need, let us give

<h2>XXXVII. LAZINESS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_84" id="SL_84"></a>84. The Sluggard.</div>

<p>You will hear of a great king (in <a href="#SL_90">Story Lesson 90</a>) who
had a throne of ivory overlaid with gold. When you are old
enough to read the words he wrote (Proverbs) you will find
that he always kept his eyes wide open and noticed things.</p>

<p>As the king was taking a walk one day, he passed by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
vineyard, which is another name for a grape-garden, and he
noticed that the wall was broken down. He looked farther,
and saw that the vines were all trailing on the ground,
instead of being tied up, and worse still, they were all grown
over with nettles and thorns&mdash;the beautiful grape vines that
give such rich, delicious fruit. "How is this?" thought
the king, and he began to consider. "Ah!" said he, "this
vineyard belongs to the man who likes 'a little sleep,' 'a
little slumber,' and who would rather fold his hands and go
to sleep again than use them to work in his garden. And
what will be the end of it all? He will soon be poor, and
have nothing to eat, while his lovely grapes which would
have sold for money if he had looked after them, lie there
buried and spoilt by the nettles and thorns."</p>

<p>It is quite right to sleep through the dark night, but this
man slept in the daytime as well, instead of weeding his
garden, and tying up the grapes, so we say he was a
sluggard. What an ugly word it is! Would <b>you</b> like to be
a sluggard? No, indeed you would not. Then remember
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Far away in a country called India there are many
elephants, which are used for hunting, and also for carrying
burdens.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>One evening a driver brought his elephant home, and
chained him to a tree; then he went a short distance away,
and made an oven to bake his cakes for supper. You will
wonder how this was done.</p>

<p>First he dug a hole in the ground, in which to place his
fuel, and when he had set the fuel alight, he covered it with
a flat stone or plate of iron, and on this he put his rice
cakes to bake. He then covered them up with grass and
stones and went away.</p>

<p>The elephant had been watching all this, and when the
man was gone, he unfastened the chain which was round
his leg with his trunk, went to the oven, uncovered the
cakes, and took them off with his trunk and ate them.
(Perhaps he waited a little while until they cooled, for the
elephant does not like his food hot.) Then he put back the
grass as before, and returned to the tree. He could not
manage to fasten the chain round his leg again, so he just
twisted it round as well as he could, and stood with his
back to the oven as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>By-and-by the driver returned, and went to see if his
cakes were ready. They were all gone, and the elephant
was peeping over his shoulder to see what would happen
next. The driver knew by his guilty look that <b>he</b> was the
thief; the elephant knew he had done wrong and was
ashamed.</p>

<p>Let us not do anything that we need be ashamed of.
We know what is right better than the elephant, because
we can think better.</p>

<h2>XXXIX. EARS AND NO EARS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>86. Heedless Albert.</div>

<p>"Listen, boys," said the teacher, "I am going to tell
you about a land across the sea, not much more than
twenty miles from England&mdash;the sunny land of France."
So he went on to tell them of the vines loaded with
grapes, from which wine is made; of the apples growing
by the roadside, and of the French people, how gay
and merry they are, and how neatly the poor people
dress.</p>

<p>Many more interesting things he told them, and then
he said: "Now, take your papers, and write down all that
you can remember about France". The boys set to work,
and soon all were very busy, except one&mdash;a boy named
Albert, who could not think of anything to write, and who,
when the papers were collected had not managed to pen
a single line. How was this, do you think? It was
simply because he had <b>not attended</b> to the teacher when
he was speaking, and so he could not remember anything
that had been told him.</p>

<p>One day, when Albert was about ten years old, his
mother sent him to a farm for some eggs. He had not
been to the farm before, but his mother told him exactly
which way to go, and if he had listened he could have
found it easily.</p>

<p>In about an hour Albert came back, swinging the empty
basket. He had not been able to find the farm. Why?
Because he did not <b>attend</b> when his mother was telling
him the way.</p>

<p>You will readily see that a child who does not attend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
cannot learn much, and will never be bright and clever,
nor of much use in helping others.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_87" id="SL_87"></a>87. Olive and Gertie.</div>

<p>Olive and Gertie were walking along a country road,
and high up in the sky a lark poured forth his sweet
song.</p>

<p>"How beautifully that skylark sings," said Olive; "it
is worth while to come out into the country just to hear
it."</p>

<p>"I did not hear it," said Gertie, swinging her parasol.</p>

<p>"It is there, right overhead," exclaimed Olive; "do look,
Gertie; it will drop like a stone when it gets nearer the
ground."</p>

<p>"Oh! I cannot trouble to look up," replied Gertie, "it
makes my neck ache."</p>

<p>By-and-by they passed a field of oats, nearly ripe, and
as the wind swayed them to and fro, they made a pleasant
rustling sound.</p>

<p>"How nice it is to hear the corn as it rustles in the
wind," said Olive, "and listen, Gertie, is not this a pretty
tinkling sound?"</p>

<p>Olive had plucked one of the ears of oats, and was
shaking its little bells close to her friend's ear.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said Gertie.</p>

<p>"To me it is lovely," replied Olive, "and the tinkle of
the harebells is just as sweet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a bee went buzzing by, and Olive liked to hear
its drowsy hum, but Gertie did not notice it.</p>

<p>Presently they were on the edge of the cliffs, and could
hear the splash of the waves as they rolled in and broke
on the beach.</p>

<p>"Surely you like to hear 'the song of the sea,'" said
Olive, but Gertie made no reply&mdash;she was thinking of
something else.</p>

<p>Do not be like Gertie, who seemed as if she had "No
Ears," but, like Olive, keep your ears open to all the
sweet and pleasant sounds.</p>

<p>The fire makes a pleasant sound as it burns and crackles
in the grate, and who does not like to hear the "singing"
of the kettle on the hob? How musical is the flow of the
stream, and do you not love to hear the splash of the oars
as they dip in the river? or the sound made by the bow
of the boat as it cuts through the water? Some people
like to hear the "thud" of a great steamer as it ploughs
its way through the sea, and everybody loves the sound
of the wind as it whispers in the trees.</p>

<p>The sounds that we hear in the fields and woods are
called "voices of nature," let us listen to them, for they
speak to us of God's love.</p>

<h2>XL. EYES AND NO EYES.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_88" id="SL_88"></a>88. The Two Brothers.</div>

<p>Have you ever heard of the "Black Country"? It is
a part of England where there are many furnaces and
iron-works, and a great deal of smoke; that is why it is
called by this name.</p>

<p>Two boys, named Francis and Algie, lived in this district,
for their father was an iron-worker, and one evening they
went out for a long walk. They were away two or three
hours, and when they returned their mother said: "Well,
boys, what did you see in your walk?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, mother," replied Algie, "there is nothing
pretty to be seen; it is all black and ugly."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Francis, "but there was the <b>sky</b>, and that
was beautiful, for we were walking towards the sunset,
and the colours were changing all the time. First the sky
seemed to be all over gold, and then as the sun went down
it changed to red; next when I looked there were shades of
a lovely green or blue, which soon changed to dark red; it
was the loveliest sunset I have ever seen."</p>

<p>How strange it was that, although both boys had eyes,
only one of them saw anything worth seeing! Francis
was the boy with "eyes," while Algie was as though he
had "no eyes". Keep your eyes open, children, and try
to see all that is beautiful. It is such a pity when people
grow up and walk about without seeing anything. There
is always something to see in the sky. Sometimes it is
all a lovely blue, with white, fleecy clouds floating across
it, or piled up in curly masses; and at night it is of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
deeper blue, and the stars come peeping out, reminding
us in their beauty of goodness and God:&mdash;</p>

<p>Little Ruby was not two years old, but she always
noticed things, and tried to find out their names.</p>

<p>One day when she was walking out with her auntie they
passed a stone wall. Ruby looked at it, and then glancing
up said, "Wall".</p>

<p>"Yes," said auntie. "What is the wall made of?"</p>

<p>"Coal," answered Ruby quite seriously. (I suppose the
blocks of stone reminded her of the same shape in the
coals.)</p>

<p>"No, it is not coal," said auntie.</p>

<p>Ruby was puzzled, and thought for a little, then she said,
"Wash it".</p>

<p>You see she had never heard the word "stone," and as
her little hands, when dirty, became lighter coloured with
<b>washing</b>, she thought that stone must be "washed" coal.
It was wrong, of course, but it shows you that tiny Ruby
used her eyes, and <b>thought</b> about things.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_90" id="SL_90"></a>90. The Daisy.</div>

<p>You have often gathered buttercups and daisies, but have
you ever gazed into the daisy's yellow eye, and thought how
wonderful it was? You will find that it is made up of many
tiny flowerets, all packed closely together. And the fringe
of white petals, tipped with pink, how beautiful <b>they</b> are!
and so dainty that we might almost think they had been
painted by the pencil of a fairy! And have you noticed
the strong, green cup which closes round the petals at
night, and keeps them all safe?</p>

<p>You have held the pretty buttercup under your chin to
make it look yellow, but have you ever looked carefully
at the shining petals of gold? How smooth, and clear,
and glossy they are!</p>

<p>There was once a great, wise king, who was so rich
that he had plates and cups of gold instead of china. He
made a beautiful throne of ivory, with six lions on the
one side and six on the other, and the throne was all
overlaid with gold; how bright and glittering it would be!
And then picture the king himself in his robes of state,
seated on his gilded throne, how dazzling and beautiful
it would all look! And yet the greatest Teacher who
ever lived&mdash;He who took the little children in his arms&mdash;said
that the great King Solomon, with his throne of ivory
and gold, "in all his glory" was not so beautiful as the
lily growing in the field. So you see the best of all beauty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
is close beside us, at our feet indeed, if we only have eyes
to see it.</p>

<p>You have heard of other beautiful sights and sounds in
the Story Lessons that have gone before (<a href="#SL_87">87</a>, <a href="#SL_88">88</a>), and in

<h2>XLII. ON DESTROYING THINGS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>91. Beauty and Goodness.</div>

<p>Why do we hang pictures on the walls, and put plants
in the windows? Because we want to make the room
look pretty.</p>

<p>Why do we love the flowers and the trees, the bright
green fields and the waving yellow corn? Why are we
so glad to be near the sea, with its glorious, rolling
waves, and to bask in the warm, bright rays of the sun?
Because they are <b>all</b> beautiful, and when we love what is
beautiful it helps us to love what is good; and when we
love <b>goodness</b> we love God, who gave us all this beauty.</p>

<p>Now you will see why it is so wicked to <b>destroy</b> beautiful
things. When a boy carves his name on a tree, or breaks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
off its graceful branches, he <b>destroys</b> that which is good,
instead of loving it; and how can he grow up gentle and
true if he does not love beauty and goodness? Sometimes
people put iron railings round their gardens, and you will
have noticed that they are often finished off with a pointed
pattern at the top, to make them look pretty. When a boy
comes along and knocks off the points, he makes the railings
look <b>ugly</b> instead of pretty. He would never think of
destroying the pictures that hang on the walls of his
home, or of throwing the plants away that stand in the
window, yet he destroys things that are <b>not his</b>, and that
other people have put there to make their houses look
nice. I am sure you will say this is not right; it is
<b>downright wrong</b>, just as wrong as it would be for me
to go and break that boy's slate, or to snap his wickets
in two when he is wanting a game of cricket, and it is
all for want of <b>thinking</b>.</p>

<p>It is quite dreadful to know that so many cruel, unkind
things are done, just because boys and girls do not trouble
to <b>think</b>! But I hope that <b>you</b>, dear children, <b>will think</b>,
and keep your little hands from spoiling anything.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>92. The Lost Path.</div>

<p>A boy named Eric was coming home from school. There
were two ways that he could take&mdash;one was a path through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the fields, and the other was a winding road. It was
winter time, and there was snow on the ground. Eric
chose the field path, for it was the shorter of the two, but
he had not gone far when it began to snow very fast. The
snow-flakes were so large, and fell so quickly, that there
was very soon quite a thick carpet on the ground, and
before long Eric found that he could not see the path, and
he scarcely knew where he was. If he had only turned
round just then, he could have seen his own footprints in
the snow, and following them, would have got back to the
road safely, but he did not want to do this, so he went on
and on until he was lost entirely, and had not the least idea
as to which was the way home.</p>

<p>Then he determined to turn back, and try to reach the
road, but where are his footprints? All covered up with
snow. Eric felt ready to cry, but he struggled on as long
as he could, and then a great drowsiness came over him,
and he fell down in the snow.</p>

<p>It is just like that with wrong-doing, if we do not turn
back at once, it becomes more and more difficult to find the
path, and sometimes the wrong-doer loses it altogether.</p>

<p>When Eric did not come home from school his parents
became very anxious, and his father accompanied by the dog
went out to seek him. First he took the way by the road,
then he came over the field-path, and the dog ran sniffing
about in the snow, until he came to what looked like a
white mound, and there was Eric half-buried in the snow.
You can imagine how pleased the father was when he had
his boy safe in his arms, and how gladly he carried him
home, for if Eric had not been found quickly, he must have
died. Remember Eric in the snow, and</p>

<h2>XLIV. ONE BAD "STONE" MAY SPOIL THE "TEMPLE".</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>93. Intemperance.</div>

<p>From all these Story Lessons you will see that there are
a great many "stones" for the building of "character".</p>

<p>But there is another thought, which is this: a <b>bad</b>
"stone," <b>one</b> bad "stone" may spoil <b>all</b> the rest. You
remember we said (<a href="#SL_77">Story Lesson 77</a>) that Selfishness could
spoil a character. And there is another fault&mdash;I think we
ought to call it a sin&mdash;that spoils the character of many an
up-grown person. I mean the sin of Intemperance. You
know what that is, do you not? When we say that people
are intemperate, we generally mean that they take too much
beer or wine, and I have known most beautiful characters
spoilt by that bad "stone".</p>

<p>When a man has lovely "stones" like Kindness, Unselfishness
and Truth in his Temple, is it not a pity that
these should be all eaten away by the dreadful sin of
Intemperance? Even truth, the foundation, decays, and
often the lovely temple of character tumbles all to ruins.</p>

<p>What should you think is the best thing for children
to do? Is it not this? Never <b>take</b> any of these things
that <b>cause</b> Intemperance, and then you will never be fond
of them, and they will never get the mastery of you and
spoil your character.</p>

<p>You have heard the ticking of your father's watch, and
have seen the hands on its face, but did you ever get a
peep inside at the wonderful tiny wheels and springs?
These are called the <b>works</b>, and if <b>they</b> are not right and
true the hands and the face are of no use at all, because
it is only when the <b>wheels</b> and <b>springs</b> work properly
that the hands can tell the time correctly.</p>

<p>It is just the same with us. If the <b>character</b> is true
and good, it will not be difficult to be polite and nice in
manner, for manners are the <b>outside</b> part of us (just as the
hands and face are the outside parts of the watch). The
kind, good thoughts <b>within</b>&mdash;in our hearts&mdash;will teach us
how to behave.</p>

<p>There is nothing that makes people so rude as thinking
of self and forgetting the comfort of others; some call it
"Thoughtlessness," but we fear the true name is "Selfishness".
If we are <b>un</b>selfish and thoughtful for others, we
shall not be likely to do anything that <b>hurts</b> people, and
so we shall not be likely to be rude.</p>

<p>In the Story Lessons on "Manners" which follow, just
see if you can find out what it is that causes each rude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
action. You will probably say that it is "<b>want of
thought</b>" for others.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(The writer would ask the teacher, or mother, who reads the
following Story Lessons to the little ones to emphasise this fact in
each&mdash;that <b>thought for others</b> induces nice manners, while
"Thoughtlessness" and "Selfishness" invariably lead to rudeness.
Spoilt children, and those whose mothers are in the habit of doing
everything for them, <b>miss</b> the training in "Thoughtfulness for
others" which is so essential to the building up of an unselfish
character; and so the mother's intended kindness is in reality <b>not</b>
kindness, seeing that it causes distinct loss to the child, <i>viz.</i>, <b>loss</b>

<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_95" id="SL_95"></a>95. Fairy Tale of Alec and his Toys.</div>

<p>Alec was a merry little fellow, full of life and fun, and a
great favourite with his aunties and uncles, who often gave
him nice presents.</p>

<p>The strange thing about Alec was that he always forgot
to say "Thank you". No matter how beautiful the present,
he would just take it and play with it, and return no thanks
to the kind giver, until his mother reminded him how rude
it was not to say "Thank you". Alec was not like little
Vernon (<a href="#SL_44">Story Lesson 44</a>), who was brimming over with
thanks.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>One night as Alec's mother was putting him to bed, she
said: "Alec, I have been reading some verses about a little
girl who would not say 'Please'. She would cry 'Pass
me the butter,' 'Give me some cheese'. So the fairies,
'this very rude maiden to tease,' carried her down into
the woods, among the butterflies and birds and bees, until
she should have learnt better manners."</p>

<p>Alec listened with wide-open eyes fixed on his mother's
face, but when she said, "I wonder what the fairies would
do with a little boy who always forgets to say 'Thank
you,'" his eyes dropped, and he was very quiet while his
mother was tucking him in his little cot.</p>

<p>When she had gone Alec thought to himself, "Suppose
the fairies should come and take all my toys away," then
he fell asleep, and this is what happened.</p>

<p>The fairies <b>did</b> come, and Alec saw them. Such funny
little fellows they were, dressed in red, with funny little
wings stuck out behind, and the funniest of little peaked
caps on their heads.</p>

<p>Alec began to wonder about his toys, and sure enough
they had come to fetch them. First they picked up a
beautiful, long railway train, which was a present from
Aunt Sophie. It took them all to lift it, there were so
many carriages. (Why do they not draw it along? thought
Alec.) Up on their shoulders it went. Would the peaked
caps fall off? No, they were all tilted sideways, and the
train was borne safely out.</p>

<p>Soon the funny little fairies came dancing in again,
laughing and rubbing their hands as they looked all about.
Surely they were not going to take the Noah's ark! <b>That</b>
was Uncle Jack's present, and the animals were such
beauties! But that did not matter to the fairies. Slowly
the ark was lifted on their shoulders; six fairies were
on one side and six on the other; again the peaked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
caps were tilted sideways, and solemnly they all marched
out.</p>

<p>Next time they pulled out a wooden horse, papa's gift,
and Alec saw that the fairies all jumped on its back, and
then a funny thing happened&mdash;the horse walked out of its
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'out'">own</ins>  accord.</p>

<p>Again and again they came in and bore away one precious
toy after another, until there was nothing left but grandpapa's
gift&mdash;the tricycle. Surely they will leave that!
Alec never knew until now how much he loved his toys;
but here they are again, and, yes! they are actually
bringing out the tricycle. One sits on the saddle, one on
each pedal, and all the rest on the handle-bar. Now the
pedals go round, and, strange to say, the funny little men
do not fall off. The tricycle seems to go of itself, as the
horse did.</p>

<p>And now, oh dear! <b>everything</b> is gone, and Alec thinks
he is worse off than the little girl who was carried away
by the fairies.</p>

<p>Morning comes! Alec wakes and rubs his eyes; what
has happened? Oh! the toys! Quick as thought he is
out of bed, and off to the playroom in his night-dress.
Where are the toys? All there, just as he left them last
night. "It was only a dream, then," said Alec; "how
glad I am that it is not true, but all the same I <b>will</b>
remember to say 'Thank you' in future," and he did.</p>

<h2>XLVII. ON BEING RESPECTFUL.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>96.</div>

<p>If you should see the sailors on board ship when they
are receiving orders from the captain, you will notice how
polite and respectful they are. They never forget to say
"Yes, sir," or "No, sir," when he speaks to them. Perhaps
the captain was once a little cabin-boy himself, and he, in
his turn, had to learn to be respectful to his captain.</p>

<p>But it is not only on board ship that it is necessary
to be respectful; children should always remember to say
"Sir" or "Ma'am" when speaking to a gentleman or lady,
wherever they may be.</p>

<p>In France the word "madam" is used when addressing
a lady, but in our country the "d" is mostly left out, and
we say only "ma'am". (Show the two words, "madam"
and "ma'am" on blackboard.)</p>

<p>No one thinks a boy or girl well-behaved who answers
"Yes," or "No"; it is blunt and rude. You can always say
"Sir" and "Ma'am," even if you do not know the name
of the person to whom you are speaking, and in answering
your father or mother you should always say "Yes, father,"
or "No, mother," as the case may be.</p>

<h2>XLVIII. PUTTING FEET UP.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>97. Alice and the Pink Frock.</div>

<p>You have often heard grown-up people say to little
children, "Behave nicely," or "Mind your manners"; I
wonder if you know just what they mean. There is a
little word that describes people who have <b>not</b> nice
manners&mdash;we say they are <b>rude</b>. Try to find out who
was rude in this story.</p>

<p>One bright day in April little Alice was dressed all ready
for a birthday party. She had on a pretty, new pink frock,
of which she was very proud, and over this she wore a
cloak, but the cloak was not quite long enough to cover
<b>all</b> the pretty dress, for which Alice was not sorry. She
was all the more pleased about the party because she had
to go by train. It was only three miles, but Alice thought
that was quite a long journey for a little girl of ten to take
all by herself.</p>

<p>Her mother brought her to the station, and when the
train came up, Alice jumped in and sat near the window,
opposite to a tall, nicely-dressed boy. Now before Alice
came into the carriage, what do you think the boy had
been doing? He had been sitting with his feet up on the
cushions opposite, and his boots were very muddy. Can
you guess the rest? Poor Alice sat down on the muddy
patches left by the boy's dirty, wet boots, and her pretty
pink frock was spoilt.</p>

<p>Can you tell who was rude in this story? "The boy was
rude." What did he do that was rude? "He put his feet
up." Then we will say, "It is rude to put our feet up". The
proper place for feet is the floor. What effect did the
boy's rudeness have on Alice? (or to younger children):<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
How did the boy's rudeness make Alice feel? It made
her unhappy. Then I think we might say that manners
are <b>rude</b> when they make other people <b>uncomfortable</b> or
<b>unhappy</b>.</p>

<p><b>Write on Blackboard and let the children repeat the
following:&mdash;</b></p>

<h2>XLIX. BANGING DOORS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_98" id="SL_98"></a>98. How Maurice came home from School.</div>

<p>How is it that boys and girls so often forget to close the
door quietly? When Maurice went out to school in the
afternoon he knew that his mother had a headache, but by
the time he came home he had forgotten all about it, and so
he stamped in with his muddy shoes unwiped, leaving the
front door wide open.</p>

<p>His mother said, "Close the door, Maurice," and he gave
it a great bang, which made her shudder.</p>

<p>Next he walked into the room, flung his bag on a chair,
his cap on the floor, and his overcoat on the sofa. Then
he said in a loud voice, "Well, mother, how's your head?"
His poor mother felt almost too sad to answer him; she
had so often told her little boy about hanging up his coat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and other things, and had tried so hard to teach him to be
gentle and polite, instead of rough and rude; but you see
Maurice was <b>thoughtless</b>, and did not remember the nice
things he had been taught.</p>

<p>Take care, Maurice! or you will have the ugly stone of
"Selfishness" in your Temple. A boy who is not kind
to his mother is the worst kind of boy, and will find it
difficult to grow up into a good and noble man.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>99. Lulu and the Glass Door.</div>

<p>When Lulu was a little girl, she lived with her auntie
and uncle. The front door of their house was made half of
glass, and there was a shutter which covered the glass part
of the door at night.</p>

<p>Lulu's auntie told her that when it was windy weather
she must go round to the <b>back</b> door, lest the front door
should get a bang, and some of the panes of glass be
broken.</p>

<p>I am afraid Lulu did not always remember to obey her
auntie, for one very windy morning she came home from
school, and went as usual to the front door. She managed
to open it and to get inside safely, then the door closed with
a loud bang, for the wind was very strong, and it happened
just as auntie had feared&mdash;a large pane of glass fell out of
the door, and was shivered into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>Auntie was very angry, and Lulu was so unhappy, and
cried so much that she could not eat her dinner. When
her uncle came home and heard the story, and knew how
sorry Lulu was, he said: "Oh, well, dry your tears, we will
call and ask old James to come and mend the door, and
my little girl must do what auntie tells her next time".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>So Lulu trotted back to afternoon school, holding to the
hand of her kind uncle, and they called to tell James to
put a new pane of glass into the door. But Lulu has not
forgotten her disobedience, and the banging of auntie's
door, although it is now more than forty years ago.</p>

<h2>L. PUSHING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>100. The Big Boy and the Little Lady.</div>

<p>The Queen was in London, and as the time drew near
when she was expected to drive through the park, many
people stood on the sidewalk to see her carriage pass.</p>

<p>A little lady who was walking through the park thought
she would stand with the others to see Her Majesty, and as
she was too short to look over the heads of the people, she
found a place at the edge of the crowd near the roadway.</p>

<p>By-and-by they heard a cheer in the distance, and knew
that the Queen's carriage had come out of the palace gates.
At that very moment some one came pushing through the
people, and before the little lady had time to speak, a great
big boy brushed rudely past, and stood in front of her.
The lady touched him on the arm, and he turned round, and
saw that it was a friend of his mother's whom he had been
treating so rudely. He raised his cap at once, and, blushing
with shame, begged the lady's pardon, and took a place
behind her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the lady had been a perfect stranger, it would have
been equally wrong for the boy to act like that. It is
always rude to push, whether we are entering a tramcar, a
railway train, or going to some place of amusement; let us
remember this:&mdash;</p>

<p>When you have been walking down the street, has it ever

<p>In London, where the streets are so busy, it would be
impossible to get along if people did not keep to the right.
What accidents we should have in the streets if the drivers
did not remember to keep to their proper side of the road,
which is the left! And how often the ships at sea would
go bumping against each other if they did not remember

<h2>LII. CLUMSY PEOPLE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_102" id="SL_102"></a>102.</div>

<p>I wonder if you know any boys and girls who are
clumsy. I am always a little sorry for clumsy people;
they seem to be so often in trouble. If the clumsy boy
is allowed to collect the slates, he is sure to send some
of them sliding on to the floor with a noise like thunder;
or if he gathers the books in a pile it is sure to topple
over, and the books are scattered in every direction. The
clumsy people tread on our toes, step on a lady's dress
and tear it maybe, or bump against baby's cot in passing
and wake the little sleeper.</p>

<p>Do you think we could find out the secret of being
clumsy? Is not it for want of taking <b>care</b>? You remember
Elinor, in <a href="#SL_79">Story Lesson 79</a>, how she upset her
tea, broke the vase, and spoilt the tablecloth, all for want
of <b>care</b>? It is the same with clumsy people&mdash;they forget
to take care?</p>

<p>The books and slates are not piled <b>carefully</b>, that is
why they tumble; they bulge out here and go in there,
instead of being smooth and straight on every side. If
you do not want to be clumsy</p>

<h2>LIII. TURNING ROUND WHEN WALKING.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_103" id="SL_103"></a>103. The Girl and her Eggs.</div>

<p>Have you ever seen a girl walking along the street with
her head turned backwards, trying to look behind her as
she goes? Of course she does not walk straight, for she
is not looking where she is going. It would be better if
she <b>did</b> either look where she is going or turn quite
round, and go where she is looking.</p>

<p>A girl was coming along the street one day with a paper
bag full of eggs, looking behind her all the time.</p>

<p>A lady, who was walking in the opposite direction, tried
to get out of her way, but as we said before, the girl could
not walk straight when her eyes were turned backward,
and as the lady stepped to one side to avoid her, the girl
in her zigzag walk came to the same side and bumped up
against the lady.</p>

<p>Crash! went the eggs, and a yellow stream ran down
the pretty blue dress worn by the lady. What would the
girl's mother say when her eggs were all wasted? This is
a true story, and you will agree that the girl was very
silly to walk along with her head turned round. You see
we have no eyes behind our head, nor even at the side;
they are at the front, so</p>

<h2>LIV. ON STARING.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>104. Ruth and the Window.</div>

<p>There was once a girl named Ruth, who was in many
respects very well-behaved indeed. For instance, you would
never hear her reply to her mother without saying "Yes,
mother," or "No, mother," and she never banged the door
or came into a room noisily, but she had <b>one</b> fault that was
really very bad.</p>

<p>As Ruth went on her way to school each day, she passed
a house that had its dining-room window facing the street.
The window was rather low, and every time that Ruth went
by she would walk slowly, and stare into the room all the
time. If the people were at dinner it made no difference&mdash;she
still gazed in. You will think this exceedingly rude,
as indeed it was, but it is quite true nevertheless.</p>

<p>One day a lady came to the school that Ruth attended;
she was driven there in her carriage, and remained talking
to the teacher after the children had been dismissed.
Presently she said, "Good afternoon," and left, and the
teacher, happening to glance out of the window, was
vexed to see that a number of the scholars had gathered
round the carriage, and were staring in, and staring at
the lady as she took her seat. Next day the children
were told how rude this was, and we hope that Ruth
learnt at the same time how rude it is to stare into
people's houses.</p>

<p>Another day some Japanese ladies came to the school
to see the children drill; they were dressed so differently
from English people, and looked so funny with their little
slanting eyes, and their shiny, black hair dressed high, with
no bonnet to cover it, that the children were tempted to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
stare again, but the teacher had told them that it would
be rude to stare at the ladies. "You may glance at them,"
said she, "but do not keep your eyes fixed on them." It
is natural to wish to look at curious things, but we can
be careful to take our eyes away when we have glanced, so
that we do not stare, and make the person uncomfortable,
for you remember we said that anything was rude which
caused people to be uncomfortable (<a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>).</p>

<p>There was a little boy in church who had just the same
rude habit as Ruth. He would sit or stand at the end of
the pew, and turn his head round to see what was passing
behind. He did not take just a little glance, and then turn
his eyes back again&mdash;even that would have been rude&mdash;but
he kept his gaze fixed behind for ever so long.</p>

<p>Do you know <b>why</b> we do not look about in church? It
is because we go there to worship the Great God, to hear
of Him, and think about Him, and we cannot do this if
we are looking about, and thinking of other things. Why
do we close our eyes when we pray? It is so that we
may think of what we are saying; if we kept them open,
we should be thinking of what we were <b>seeing</b> instead,
should we not?</p>

<h2>LV. WALKING SOFTLY.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>105. Florence Nightingale.</div>

<p>A long time ago there was a war, and the English soldiers
went out to fight. Many of the poor fellows were wounded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and a kind lady, who is now quite old, went from England
to nurse the brave soldiers. Her name was Florence Nightingale,
and it is a name that everybody loves.</p>

<p>The soldiers had never been nursed by a lady before, and
she was so kind and gentle, they loved her more than I can
tell you&mdash;so much, indeed, that they would kiss her shadow
on the pillow as she walked softly through the rooms where
they lay.</p>

<p>If you have ever been in a hospital you will know how
quietly the nurses move about. Why is it? Because a
noise would disturb the poor sufferers. But it is not nice
for people who are well either to hear children stamping
about as if they would send their feet through the floor.
Have you noticed how softly pussy moves? It is because
she walks on her toes. We have to wear shoes on our feet,
and cannot help making a little noise, but we must
remember to step on our toes, and move as quietly as
possible.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_106" id="SL_106"></a>106. The Civil Boy.</div>

<p>One day a lady was passing through a country village,
and not being quite sure as to which was the right road to
take, she went up to some boys who were playing on the
green to inquire.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>"Can you tell me, please, which is the way to East
Thorpe?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said one of the boys, raising his cap, "you
walk straight past the church, and then take the first road
to the right." The lady thanked the boy, and bade him
"Good-day," and as he replied "Good-day, ma'am," and
again raised his cap, she thought to herself, "What a
civil, polite boy! He is very poorly dressed, but he has the
manners of a gentleman, and how nicely he answered when
I spoke to him; I must tell Dorothy about it."</p>

<p>Dorothy was the lady's little niece, and had been staying
with her some time. One afternoon auntie had taken
Dorothy with her to call at the house of a friend, and when
the lady spoke kindly to the little girl, and asked her name
and where she lived, Dorothy only smiled and looked foolish,
and did not speak or answer. Her auntie was very much
surprised, and perhaps felt a wee bit ashamed of her little
niece that afternoon.</p>

<p>Children should never be bold and forward, but they
<b>should</b> look up and answer a question fearlessly and clearly

least she <b>looked</b> like a lady, and was dressed most
elegantly. Her gown was of silk, over which she wore a
rich fur-lined cloak, and her bonnet was quite smart with
feathers and flowers. As she drew off her gloves, you
could not help noticing that her fingers were covered with
glittering rings. "Surely she must be going to some grand
concert, or to a party," thought we.</p>

<p>But listen to what happened next! Just before the
train started she suddenly opened the carriage window,
and leaning out as far as ever she could, shouted in a
loud, rough voice, so loudly that all the people round
could hear, "Heigh! you porter there, is my luggage all
right?" Then she closed the window and sat down, and
we felt that in spite of her finery she was a rude, rough
woman, for a lady is gentle, and would never speak in a
loud, coarse voice that grates on those who hear it.</p>

end of the garden, having a happy time with their dolls,
and Helena was telling Margery that her father had
promised to take them all for a picnic to the hills next
day. They were to drive there in a coach, papa, mamma,
Helena, and her brothers, who were all at home for the
holidays.</p>

<p>Just then Helena's mamma came walking down the
garden. "Good-morning, Margery," said she, and Margery
stood up at once and returned her greeting. "I have
been thinking," said Mrs. Poynter, "that you would like
to join our picnic to-morrow, and I am sure we could find
room for one more on the coach."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, ma'am," said Margery, "I should like
it so much; I will run round and ask mother at once,"
and off she ran as fast as her little legs could carry her.</p>

<p>Margery came into the house bubbling over with the good
news, and anxious to tell it all to her mother immediately,
but she found that a lady had called and was talking to
her mother, so she just waited quietly until the conversation
was ended before she spoke a word, for Margery knew that</p>

<p>In a previous Story Lesson, <a href="#SL_106">No. 106</a>, we spoke of a village
boy who, you remember, answered the lady politely, when
she inquired her way. His name was Fred, and when a
gentleman came to the school that Fred attended one day,
and said he wanted an office-boy, the schoolmaster called
Fred up to the desk. The boy looked so bright and honest,
and said, "Yes, sir" so politely, that the gentleman thought
he would do, and the next week Fred began his work.
Sometimes he had to sit at a desk and do writing; one
morning as he sat thus, the master came in to speak to him.
What do you think Fred did? He rose from his stool at
once, turned towards his master, and stood while he was
speaking. The master was giving Fred instructions about

<h2>LX. ON TALKING TOO MUCH.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>110.</div>

<p>One evening a number of friends met together at a little
party. First they all had tea, and after tea was over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
they sat round the fire to talk, for some of them had
not seen each other for a long time. But there was one
lady there who had so much to say that scarcely any one
else could get a chance to speak. She talked and talked
nearly all the evening. Sometimes we <b>expect</b> one person
to speak all the time, as when we go to hear a lecture, or
to listen to a sermon in church, but when people meet
together for conversation, it is much pleasanter to hear
<b>more</b> than one speak.</p>

<p>Another time three children were having dinner with
some grown-up people, and a lady who was there told me
that one of the children, a little girl about eight years of
age, talked continually, so that even the grown-up people
had scarcely an opportunity of speaking.</p>

<p>So you see it is quite possible for people to be made
uncomfortable by a child speaking too much, as well as by
a child that refuses to speak at all (Dorothy in <a href="#SL_106">Story Lesson 106</a>).</p>

<p>Perhaps you have been in a railway carriage where a
little boy has never ceased asking questions and talking
during the whole journey. Years ago children used to be
told that "they must be seen and not heard". We do
not often say that now, but we must remember that it is
rude to take up all the conversation, or even more than our
share. I believe it is more than rude&mdash;it is selfish. We
must learn to listen to other people as well as to talk
ourselves.</p>

<h2>LXI. GOING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_111" id="SL_111"></a>111. Minnie and the Book.</div>

<p>One evening Minnie sat at the table preparing her lessons.
Her father and mother, with an aunt who had called to see
them, were seated at the hearth.</p>

<p>In a little while Minnie found that she required a book
from the bookcase, which stood in a recess to the left of
the fireplace, so she rose from the table, and, without
speaking a word, walked in <b>front</b> of her aunt and in
<b>front</b> of her father to reach the book. Her aunt looked
up in astonishment, and her father exclaimed: "Minnie,
how <b>rude</b> you are!"</p>

<p>Why was Minnie rude? Because she did not say
"Excuse me, please," both to her aunt and her father.
We ought <b>not</b> to go in front of any one, if we can by any
means avoid it; but, if it is impossible to get behind, we
must never forget to say those little words which Minnie
so rudely forgot.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>112. The Man and his Luggage.</div>

<p>A gentleman was travelling in a railway train, and, as
there was no one else in the carriage, he placed his
portmanteau and other luggage on the rack <b>opposite</b> to
where he sat instead of overhead.</p>

<p>At the next station several people entered the carriage,
and, when the gentleman wanted to get out, he was obliged
to reach up in front of the people sitting opposite to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
his luggage. But he did not forget to say, "Excuse me,
please".</p>

Reaching in Front, always say "Excuse me,

<h2>LXII. WHEN TO SAY "I BEG YOUR PARDON".</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>113.</div>

<p>I was talking to a lady one day, and not happening to
hear something that I said, she exclaimed in a loud voice,
"<b>What?</b>" I was as much astonished as Minnie's aunt
was in <a href="#SL_111">Story Lesson 111</a>, and quite forgot what I had
intended to say next. What should the lady have said?
She should have said, "I beg your pardon". Perhaps
she had forgotten herself just that one time.</p>

<p>Suppose you are sitting at table next to mother, who is
pouring the tea; perhaps there is no bread and butter
near enough for her to reach, and you do not notice that
her plate is empty. She is obliged to ask you to pass her
something, and as you do so you feel sorry that you have
not done it <b>without</b> being asked, and you say, "I beg
your pardon, mother". Some people leave out the "<b>I</b>,"
and say "Beg your pardon," or "Beg pardon," but the
proper words are, "I beg your pardon".<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>114. The Lady and the Poor Boy.</div>

<p>A young lady was hurrying down a street, and, as she
turned the corner quickly, she nearly ran against a little
ragged boy, but by putting out her arms she just managed
to save him from being hurt. Then she rested her hands
on his shoulders, and said in a sweet voice: "I beg your
pardon, my boy". The boy was greatly surprised that
any one should beg <b>his</b> pardon; he had not been accustomed
to have people speak politely to him, but the lady
knew that it is just as important to be polite to a beggar
as to a fine gentleman.</p>

<p>We should, of course, try <b>not</b> to run against people,
and be careful <b>not</b> to step on a lady's dress or on any one's
toes, but if by accident we <b>do</b> make any of these blunders,
we must remember to say, "I beg your pardon".</p>

<h2>LXIII. RAISING CAP.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>115.</div>

<p>Why is it, do you think, that a boy raises his cap? It is
to show respect to the lady or gentleman whom he is passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
or speaking to. That was why the boy raised his cap
to the lady in <a href="#SL_106">Story Lesson 106</a>, and said "Yes, ma'am;" he
wished to show her respect. Soldiers do not raise their
caps to the general or captain; they salute (that is, they
raise the forefinger of right hand to forehead), but it answers
the same purpose&mdash;it shows their respect. Why do men and
boys take off their caps and hats when they enter a church
or chapel? It is to show reverence to the God of all who is
worshipped there.</p>

<p>Boys should always remember to raise their caps when a
lady or gentleman bows or speaks to them, and also when
they enter a house or other place, such as a church or
chapel.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>LXIV. ON OFFERING SEAT TO LADY.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>116.</div>

<p>A number of soldiers were one day riding in a car, indeed
the car was quite full of soldiers; and at the end there
was a general, that is the man who is at the head of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Presently the car stopped, and a poor old woman entered,
but there was no room for her to sit, and not one of the
soldiers had the good manners to offer her his seat. So the
woman walked to the end of the car where the general sat,
that she might stand where she would not be in any one's
way, but the kind general rose instantly, and gave her his
place; that was courteous and kind of him, was it not?
Then several of the other soldiers stood, and asked the
general to be seated, but he said: "No, there was no seat for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the poor woman, so there is none for me". The soldiers
were very much ashamed, and soon left the car.</p>

<p><b>Why</b> did the general offer his seat to the old woman?
For the same reason that the boy raises his cap&mdash;to show
respect to her.</p>

<p>You know how father takes care of mother and lifts heavy
weights for her, and how brothers take care of sisters, and
so if there is not room for everybody to sit, a man or boy
will rise, and let a woman have his place; and they do all
this partly because they are strong and like to do kind acts,
and partly because it is nice and right to be courteous to
women.</p>

<p>But a kind woman does not like always to take the seat
that is offered to her. The man may be old or weak, then the
woman would say, "Thank you, I will stand," for she sees
that the man needs the seat more than she does. And if a
man had been working hard all day (never sitting down at
all maybe), and he should be coming home tired at night, in
the train or tramcar, one would not like to let <b>him</b> stand,
and give up his place.</p>

<p>It is nice and polite for a man to <b>offer</b> his seat, and the
lady should always say, "Thank you," whether she takes it
or not.</p>

<p>A very old man entered a crowded railway carriage, and
a young girl who was sitting near the door stood up at once
and offered the old man her place, for she knew that he was
too weak to stand. So you see that sometimes it is right
for a girl or woman to give up her seat; we must not let the
men do <b>all</b> the kind, polite actions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2>LXV. ON SHAKING HANDS.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>117. Reggie and the Visitors.</div>

<p>One afternoon I called with a friend to see a lady at
whose house I had not been before; she was very pleased
to see us, and brought her little boy, Reggie, into the
room where we sat.</p>

<p>"Shake hands with the ladies, Reggie," said his mother;
but Reggie refused, and hid his face in her dress. She
explained that he was shy, and went on coaxing him to
come and speak to us. After a great deal of talking and
persuading, he consented to come and shake hands, <b>if</b> his
mother would come with him. So she brought him across
the room, and held out his hand, just as you hold out the
arm of your doll, when you play at shaking hands with
her.</p>

<p>Would <b>you</b> make all that fuss and trouble about shaking
hands with any one? I hope not. It is so silly, as well as
ill-mannered.</p>

<p>After this Reggie sat down in a little chair, and tried
to put his feet up on a small table that was near&mdash;but you
will not care to hear about such a badly-behaved little
boy. And it was not very long before his mother had to
take him from the room screaming, he was so tiresome
and naughty.</p>

<p>If Reggie had tried to please his mother and her visitors,
instead of his little <b>self</b>, everybody would have been much
happier, and I am sure <b>he</b> would, for selfish people cannot
be happy.</p>

<h2>LXVI. KNOCKING BEFORE ENTERING A ROOM.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>118. The Boy who Forgot.</div>

<p>A lady was sitting in a cottage one morning talking to
the person who lived there, when suddenly, and without
any warning knock, or even a little tap, some one lifted
the latch noisily, and pushing the door wide open, burst
into the room, asking, "What time is it?"</p>

<p>The lady looked up to see who the rude intruder could
be, and beheld a little, rosy-faced boy. She called him to
her, and placing her hand on his shoulder said kindly: "My
little fellow, do you not know that you should <b>knock</b> at
a door before entering, and should say, '<b>Please</b>, will you
tell me the time?'" The boy hung his head and looked
ashamed, but we hope he remembered what the lady said
to him, and I hope also that none of you ever forget to</p>

<h2>LXVII. HANGING HATS UP, ETC.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>119. Careless Percy.</div>

<p>You did not admire the boy (<a href="#SL_98">Story Lesson No. 98</a>) who
threw his bag here, his cap there, and his coat somewhere
else, did you? neither will you be likely to admire the little
boy in this story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>But come with me&mdash;I will take you into the bedroom of
a boy named Percy, who has gone to a party. I am afraid
you can scarcely get inside though, for everything he has
taken off is lying on the floor. His coat is flung behind the
door, his collar lies inside the fender, and his trousers are
beside the bed. He has been playing on the bed, you see,
for it is all tossed, and one of the pillows has tumbled on
the floor.</p>

<p>Let as take a peep into the nursery, where Percy's play-things
are. There is a railway train on the floor, just as
he has been playing with it; and beyond the train, where he
had made a huge castle with all the bricks he could find,
the floor is all strewn over with bricks from the castle, which
has tumbled down.</p>

<p>Who will pick up all these things, and tidy the two rooms
that Percy has left in such a dreadful state? His mother,
maybe, who has so many other things to do. Would <b>you</b>
leave all your clothes scattered on the floor for some one else
to pick up, instead of folding them neatly yourself? or would
you like another to have the trouble of putting away all
your toys? No, I am sure you would not. None of us
want to be selfish, but if Percy does not mind, <b>he</b> will grow
up selfish, because he is not taking thought for others.</p>

<h2>LXVIII. HOW TO OFFER SWEETS, ETC.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>120. How Baby Did it.</div>

<p>Some one had brought baby a parcel of sweets. They were
rather sticky, but baby did not mind that when the colours
were so pretty! There were pink, blue, red and yellow
sweets, and she was greatly pleased with them. Baby was
very kind and unselfish, so she wanted us all to share her
sweets, and picking one out with her little chubby fingers,
(which were not any too clean), she offered it to mamma.
You see baby was very tiny, and had not yet learnt that
sweets should always be offered in the paper or box, and not
be touched by the fingers at all. But mamma explained
this to her, and then baby lifted up the paper, and trotted
round to everybody, holding it out, and saying, "Please, take
one".</p>

<p>Fruit and nuts should be offered in a plate or dish. It is
not nice to touch with our fingers anything that we are
offering to others.</p>

<h2>LXIX. YAWNING, COUGHING, AND SNEEZING.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>121.</div>

<p>I daresay you have sometime been in a room where a
person was sleepy, and kept yawning continually. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
know that by-and-by you begin to do the same yourself,
and it is very disagreeable. A good plan is to run out
of the room and bathe your face in cold water: that will
soon make you feel bright again. It is not nice to yawn,
because it makes other people feel sleepy, and we should
never forget to cover the mouth with the hand: it is very
rude to open the mouth wide, and not to put the hand in
front of it.</p>

<p>In coughing and sneezing, people should make as little
noise as they possibly can. Sometimes we hear coughing
in church, and the minister can scarcely speak for the
noise. A pocket-handkerchief will soften the sound a
good deal, both in coughing and sneezing.</p>

<p>These are only little things, but they can make others
feel uncomfortable, and you remember we said that it
was rude to do <b>anything</b> that caused people to be
uncomfortable (<a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>), so do not forget to</p>

<h2>LXX. HOW A SLATE SHOULD NOT BE CLEANED.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>122.</div>

<p>You will have noticed that there is always moisture in
your mouth. Where do you think it comes from? Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
you did not know that there were six tiny fountains in your
mouth, two on each side the tongue, and one in each cheek.
When you are well these little fountains pour out the fluid
which keeps your mouth so nice and moist. Sometimes
when people are ill the little fountains do not flow, and
the mouth is all dry and parched, and they are longing
to drink all the time.</p>

<p>The fluid that comes from the tiny wells is called saliva,
and, when we eat, it mixes with the food in the mouth,
and goes down with it into the stomach. But this is
what I want you to learn, the saliva is never to be sent
out of the mouth in the way that is called "spitting"
(an ugly word, is it not?), and you must remember never
to do this, not even when you are cleaning your slate.
You may breathe on your slate, and rub it dry with your
slate rag, though that is not a very nice way. The best
plan of all is to have a damp sponge, as well as a slate
rag, and a well-mannered child would have both.</p>

<p>If there is anything in your mouth that needs to come
away, take it out with your pocket-handkerchief, and
remember that the proper way is to</p>

124. Phil's Disaster.</div>

<p>Phil was a little boy, and sat on a high chair at the table.
He was very fond of tilting his chair backwards and
forwards, which was not well-mannered, you will say. One
dinner time, just as all the dishes had been placed on the
table, and Phil was tilting back as far as ever he could, it
happened that the chair lost its balance, and fell over backwards,
taking Phil with it; and as he grasped the tablecloth
in falling, he drew it with all the dishes on the top of him.
Many of the dishes were broken, and the dinner was all
scattered and spoilt. Surely Phil would never tilt his chair
again.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'><a name="SL_125" id="SL_125"></a>125. Fidgety Katie.</div>

<p>Have you ever sat at table with a child who was never
still? Such a child was Katie! Instead of waiting quietly
until every one was served, she would fidget about on her
chair, put her little fat arms on the table (which you know
is a very rude thing to do), and move from side to side all
the time. When at last she was served, her dinner would
be quickly eaten, and then she was impatient to be gone,
and kept asking mother if she might not leave the table,
and go to her book or her play.</p>

<p>Now if Katie had thought a little of others, she would not
have made everybody uncomfortable by being so restless.
When she was waiting to be served, and when she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
finished, she should have sat quietly with her hands in her
lap. These two stories teach us that</p>

<p>A very different child from restless Katie (<a href="#SL_125">Story Lesson 125</a>) was Hilda, whose mother had died, and left her little
ones to the care of auntie. When the dinner-bell rang, Hilda
would run into the room, and see that all the chairs were
in their places round the table, especially baby's, for he was
much too little to bring his own chair. It was Hilda who
lifted baby into his place, and tied on his "feeder"; and
when his plate was passed, she prepared his food, and
took care that it was not too hot for him.</p>

<p>Hilda's bright eyes were always ready to see anything
that was needed: "Shall I pass you the salt, grandpapa?"
"May I give you a little water, auntie?" No wonder
auntie said that Hilda was just like sunshine in the house,
and the reason was that she thought so little of herself, and
so much of those around her. Let us try to be like Hilda;
she was much happier, I am sure, than restless Katie, for
there is nothing nicer than to bring sunshine into the lives
of others, and this we do by being helpful.</p>

caught the tablecloth, and by dragging it upset the gravy,
and sent it streaming all over the nice, clean cloth. Leslie
was very sorry, and his mother was so uncomfortable at

<p>One day a boy, named Kenneth, was invited out to
dinner, and one of the dishes was cherry tart. There
was a custard pudding as well, but Kenneth thought he
would like cherry tart better, and he did not remember
that the stones might be a difficulty until he began to eat
it. He felt sure that it was not right to drop them out
of his mouth on to the plate, and he could not think
what else to do. He looked round the table, but no one
else was taking cherry tart, or he might have noticed what
another person did. At last he determined that he would
keep all the cherry stones in his cheek until dinner was
over, and put them out afterwards, when no one was
looking. But presently some one told a funny little story,
and, as Kenneth could not help laughing with the rest,
out came the cherry stones, to his great dismay.</p>

<p>The best way is to separate the stone from the cherry
on your plate with the spoon and fork, but if you cannot
manage this, take the stone from your mouth with the
spoon, and put it gently on the edge of the plate. Everybody
has to learn these things, and as no one had
happened to tell Kenneth, of course he did not know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<h2>LXXIV. FINALE.</h2>


<div class='sectiontitle'>131. How another Queen Builded.</div>

<p>A great many years ago, a little girl played in a garden in
London. Her father was dead, but she had a dear, good
mother, who taught her to build for herself a good and
beautiful character, for the mother knew that this would
be a better thing for the little girl to have than gold or
diamonds, because as the Fairy Queen told us, it <b>lasts for
ever</b>.</p>

<p>As time went on the little girl grew up, and became a
great queen. She has been a queen now for more than
sixty years, and I do not think there ever was so good a
queen, and we are sure there never was one so dearly
loved. The queen has a beautiful gold crown, and beautiful
castles and palaces to live in, but these are not the things
she values most. Best of all, she has all those lovely jewels
in her character that we have been speaking about, with
"Truth" for the foundation, and it is all woven round with
the pure gold of "Kindness"; these are the jewels that are
more precious to the great queen than crowns and costly
stones.</p>

<p>Do you know the name of this queen? It is our own
Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Why do we love her so much? Not because she is a
queen, simply, for queens have sometimes been wicked, but
because she is good, and true, and kind, and these jewels
make up the something that we call "character," which
when built like this is more beautiful than the Fairies'
Temple.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>And just think of it: <b>every</b> little boy and girl may build
up a good, true character, which is the most precious thing
you can have.</p>

<p>The Story Lessons in this book have been written to help
each one of <b>you</b> who hear them to build up this beautiful
Temple of Character.</p>

<p>The queen believes that a <b>good</b> "character" is the best
thing in the world, and I want you all to think so too.</p>

<p>A man who was put in prison for preaching wrote a
beautiful book,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> which you will read when you are older,
and in it there is this story.</p>

<p>The story tells of a man who spent all his time raking
up rubbish on the floor to find gold and other things, and
<b>never once looked up</b>. But all the time there was an
angel standing behind him with a beautiful crown in her
hand, which she wanted the man to have, but he never
saw it.</p>

<p>That is like the people who think of nothing but <b>self</b>,
instead of "looking up" and thinking of the beautiful
"stones" that build up the "Temple," which is such a
good thing to have, just as the crown was, which the man
did not see. Let us look up and see all that is beautiful and
good, so that we may become like God who made all these
things.</p>
